"Several factors have contributed to a downward trend in postgraduate education enrollment in Vietnamese higher education. Understanding postgraduate students’ university choice criteria is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies in higher education settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate postgraduate students’ perceptions of their university choices and to evaluate the correlations between their marketing and communication, social support, and economic factors and their university choices. A survey consisting of 401 questionnaires and 05 semi-structured interviews was conducted at some of the most prestigious multidisciplinary universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The findings reveal that postgraduate students generally show a high degree of agreement in their university choice decisions. Additionally, differences in demographic characteristics, such as family income and father's education, were found to influence their preferences. Furthermore, the study suggests that marketing and communication, social support, and economic factors have varying and significant impacts, both positive and negative, on their decisions. The results of this study hold theoretical and practical implications for Vietnamese higher education. Recommendations for university administrators and other stakeholders are also discussed. © (2023) by Cherkas Global University.",Duong M.-Q.; Le T.-P.; Bach T.-N.-D.; Le M.-T.,Tactical,10.13187/ejced.2023.4.1198,economic factor; marketing and communication; social support; university choice decision; Vietnamese postgraduate student,5.0,,15,0,Cherkas Global University Press,"The study investigates specific factors influencing postgraduate students' university choices, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets and structured decisions.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,"Vietnamese Postgraduate Students’ Choices for Higher Education: Exploring How Marketing and Communication, Social, and Economic Factors Influence Their Decision-Making",2023
"This study unpacks how a person’s multiple identities affect their decision making when selecting a tourism destination. We propose that different aspects of identity yield distinct yet competing emotions. For instance, perceived social audience admiration combined with animosity might produce ambivalence, leading to greater decision-making uncertainty. Findings show that tourists with greater ambivalence towards particular destination countries are more likely to cancel or postpone their travel decisions. Additionally, the destination country’s economic development and a tourist’s pursuit of material happiness interact as moderators in the relationships between identities, emotions, and travel intention. Recommendations are provided for tourism product development and marketing communications for destination countries. © 2022 The Author(s).

"It is already a fact that young people are addicted to social networks, particularly, generation Z. This social-savvy netizen uses social networks extensively to engage with socially connected people, but also actively interacts with online retailers and brands through social networks. This suggests that generation Z consumers seamlessly involve their connected social community to obtain reviews and recommendations, and then use this information to guide their purchasing decisions. This study argued that desire is the leading predictor influence online social shopping purchase intention. We applied the Model of Goal-directed behaviour to examine the influence of social desire and commercial desire on online social shopping purchase intention. At the same time, it attempts to examine whether social desire and commercial desire play a mediator role. This study, which is confined to Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, focuses on generation Z consumers aged 17 to 26 years old. A total of 288 samples were collected using the purposive sampling technique and analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings revealed that social attitude influences social desire and commercial attitude influenced commercial desire. Lastly, online social shopping purchase intention was influenced by both social desire and commercial desire. It indicates that both social desire and commercial desire play a mediating role. The results provide valuable insight for online social retailers, online social shopping platform operators, and marketers to develop a balanced social marketing strategy and to entice online social shopping purchase intention through social and commercial activity engagement. © 2023 Journal of Applied Structural Equation Modeling.",Leong T.K.; Huam H.T.,Tactical,10.47263/JASEM.7(1)05,Commercial attitude; Commercial Desire; Model of Goad-directed Behaviour; Online Social shopping purchase intention; Social attitude; Social Desire,5.0,,15,0,Sarawak Research Society,"The study focuses on understanding the factors influencing online social shopping purchase intention among generation Z consumers.

"Purpose: The growth in social content such as video facilitates consumer exposure to social information at e-tail settings. Research has recommended enhancing the e-store socialness. Focusing on focal consumer outcomes (flow and purchase intentions), the current research delineates a boundary condition, proposing that e-tail socialness improves outcomes when the consumer interdependent self, rather than the independent self, is activated. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental approach is employed to test the research thesis. Two experiments (N1 = 303 Females 42.4%; N2 = 387 Females 51.4%) that used different manipulation for socialness and sample frames (USA and Canadian) are performed. Analysis of variance was applied. Findings: The results generally support the research thesis, suggesting that e-tail socialness enhances consumer flow and purchase intentions when the interdependent self is activated. The effect, however, is marginal for segments with high brand preference. Practical implications: As more information increase overload and reduce decision quality, e-tail practitioners should focus on providing social information predominately for consumers whose interdependent self is activated. This recommendation is particularly relevant for segments with low brand preference. Originality/value: So far, studies recommend enhancing the e-store socialness, or increasing the social volume, to achieve better outcomes. Such research stream is giving rise to the “social is better in e-tail” conventional wisdom. The current work contributes by delineating a boundary condition based on consumer self-construal. This work suggests that the use of online socialness is fruitful predominantly for interdependent consumers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Aljukhadar M.; Senecal S.,Tactical,10.1108/BJM-10-2022-0397,Digital marketing; E-store socialness; Etsy; Flow; Purchase intentions; Social cues,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract focuses on enhancing e-tail socialness to improve consumer outcomes like flow and purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific marketing targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Consumer self-construal modulates the relevance of E-tail socialness,2023
"PURPOSE: The main purpose of this qualitative study was to explore tech start-up failures in Sri Lanka to emerge themes that explain the critical factors that are impacting failures of Sri Lankan tech start-ups and also to identify recommendations that could help evade those factors. The paper also presents the finding to enrich tech entrepreneurs to build their strategies with an understanding of factors that leads to failure and to make well-educated decisions. METHODOLOGY: The study is based on a qualitative research approach that helps to present findings in a theoretical way. A phenomenological analysis has been used to identify, understand, and analyze the phenomena of tech start-up failures. Twelve start-up leaders participated in this study and shared their lived experiences of tech start-up failures in Sri Lanka. Interviews were conducted with them based on twelve interview questions and twelve core themes emerged based on the participants’ lived experiences. In analyzing data, the modified Van Kaam approach was used, utilizing a seven-step framework that considers the structural and textual aspects of experiences, as well as the perceptual characteristics of the phenomenon. FINDINGS: The themes answered the key research question of the study: What are the critical factors that are impacting on failures of tech start-ups in Sri Lanka? The cause of tech start-up failures according to the current study varied including, financial uncertainty, no market research, no product–market fit, paranoid behaviors of innovators, lack of timely response to changing conditions, and location of the venture. IMPLICATIONS: The paper concisely presents twelve critical reasons for tech start-up failures. The results of the research will enable Sri Lankan tech start-ups to identify key factors of failure for the growth of their surviving strategies. Identifying secret obstacles in the industry helps entrepreneurs prepare for pitfalls and provides guidelines for policymakers to make informed choices when implementing national policies. More importantly, it has been discovered that the major areas that require more attention are leadership, funding, marketing, and innovation. Finally, four groups of recommendations have been discussed under financing, market research, leadership, and inventors. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The comparison of the current study themes with the findings of related studies is inconclusive because the literature on tech start-up failures in other countries and in Sri Lanka is minimal. Some of the themes align with the findings of research conducted in other countries, although there were some themes that were explored uniquely. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeline for economic growth in both developed and emerging markets; however, they continue to face growth challenges. Theoretically, SMEs are major contributors to employment creation, wealth generation and poverty alleviation. Literature shows that SME sustainability is affected by a variety of variables, including reputation. The article seeks to analyse the relationship between SME entrepreneurial marketing, described as customer intensity and proactiveness, and overall performance, associated with consumer reputation, in emerging markets. Three hypotheses were generated from literature review, and they were tested through empirical data collected from Manicaland Province SMEs. The hypotheses relate to the linkages between entrepreneurial marketing and overall SME performance. A total of 190 entrepreneurs operating SMEs in Manicaland Province were surveyed. Through convenience sampling, entrepreneurs who employ a minimum of five people were selected from all the districts of Manicaland Province. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the three hypotheses. The article finds that two dimensions of entrepreneurial marketing impact on overall SME performance. Three strategic recommendations arise from this article that may improve the impact of entrepreneurship marketing on the performance of SMEs, and they are detailed under the last section. Together, the three strategic recommendations imply that SMEs marketing has to rely on research in order to: gain understanding of determinants and outcomes of international entrepreneurship and innovation; analyse possible matrices of strategic approaches to international entrepreneurship management in decision-making; and exploit the potential for using corporate social behaviour as a niche for gaining competitive advantage for sustainable development. © Journal of Global Business and Technology.",Mutanho D.; Shumba T.,Strategic,,Emerging Markets; Entrepreneurship; Marketing; Small and Medium Enterprises; Zimbabwe,5.0,,10,0,"Global Business and Technology Association, Inc.","The abstract discusses the long-term implications of entrepreneurial marketing on SME performance, indicating a focus on strategic goals and planning for sustainable development in emerging markets.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,"IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL MARKETING ON OVERALL SME PERFORMANCE IN MANICALAND PROVINCE, ZIMBABWE",2024
"The considerable marketing potential brought by the rapid growth of social media has been extensively examined in the literature, particularly in terms of the impact of influencers' recommendations on their followers' decisions. However, little attention has been given to how the individual influencers' use of multiple social networking sites affects their followers' behavioral intentions. Hence, this academic gap warrants further exploration. Drawing on cue consistency theory, social identity theory, and stimulus-organism-response framework, this research proposes three research questions and constructs an integrated research model to explore how the influencers' cue consistency affects the social identification of their followers, subsequently influencing their behavioral intentions. A structural equation modeling technique is performed to analyze the data of 510 valid respondents. The findings show that influencers' consistent cues (i.e., information and image consistency) across social media have positive impacts on followers' cognitive and affective identification toward the influencers. Furthermore, the determinants for followers' purchase intention and electronic word-of-mouth intention are affirmed to serve as both cognitive and affective identification. Especially, the results indicate that the relationships between followers’ social identifications and behavioral intentions are moderated by the type of influencer (i.e., lifestyle vs. review). Accordingly, the results indicate how the use of multiple social networking sites by influencers impacts the behavioral intentions of their followers. The findings offer new insights into influencer marketing and provide important lessons for marketers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Hsieh J.-K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103397,Cue consistency theory; Influencer marketing; Multi-SNS usage; Social identity theory; Social networking site (SNS); Stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The research explores the impact of influencers' consistent cues on followers' behavioral intentions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions.

"This study revealed two different sets of push and pull factors affecting the medical travel decision process of two groups of mainland Chinese to Hong Kong, including potential and experienced medical tourists. The relations between identified factors and their willingness of personal visit and recommendation were also investigated. Regarding the recommendation intention, interpersonal acquisition and personal needs satisfaction are mostly considered by travelers in psychological level while recognized high medical reception capacity and quality are also prioritized in the pull aspect. However, local medical service constraints, perceived quality of medical experience shaped by healthcare suppliers, and destination attributes determine the two groups' responses to personal visit intention. Besides, the advantages of developing medical tourism in Hong Kong are implicated as can-be-perceived unique cultural attribute, mass tourism fame as medical tourism development basis, and reputation for high-quality care formed with unintentional or deliberate promotion from third parties and various marketing channels. © 2024 The Authors.

"Whereas much research has looked at how recommendation systems influence online purchase intentions, this article illustrates the dual process model by which they occur. Using two studies, we fill the research void in interactive marketing by demonstrating how the dual processes of social proof and risk avoidance mediate the impact of recommendation labels on consumer decision-making contingent upon their level of involvement. Study 1 (n = 73), used a mixed-subjects design with a college student sample to demonstrate that both types of recommendation labels will lead to higher purchase intentions in an online setting. Most importantly, it provides evidence for the main effect of our theoretical model across different product categories. Study 2 (n = 160) provides support for our remaining four hypotheses by demonstrating the underlying process through which recommendation labels have a two-fold effect on purchase intentions. Specifically, the recommendation label increased the risk avoidance effect for high-involvement consumers and enhanced the social proof effect for low-involvement consumers. In both cases, the recommendation labels increased purchase intentions. Implications of our findings for theoretical and practical contributions and future directions are also explored. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Xu L.; Roy A.; Niculescu M.,Tactical,10.1080/15332861.2022.2049113,Low and high involvement; online purchase intention; recommendation label; risk avoidance; social proof,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses how recommendation systems affect consumer decision-making through specific mediators such as social proof and risk avoidance.

"Purpose: There is much evidence in the literature showing the benefits of input market participation on farmers’ welfare. The same is true for participation in marketing. However, there are very few studies on the expected benefit of input market participation and marketing. This study fills this gap by examining the issue in the Senegalese context for food and cash crops. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression using a highly detailed 2017 agricultural survey in Senegal. They first identify factors that shape farmers’ decision to participate in the input market and marketing and then assess the impact of market participation choices on farmers’ profits. Findings: The results show that the most profitable market participation regime depends on the crop under consideration. For food crops, joint participation in markets maximizes profit per hectare, while for groundnuts, the main cash crop in Senegal, participation in the input market is not necessary to maximize farm profit. Research limitations/implications: Using panel data would improve the quality of estimations (time-variant effects) and help to consider the role of risk in output and input markets. Originality/value: This paper helps to characterize different profiles of farmers based on their market participation and crop choices and provide policymakers with recommendations for maximizing farmers’ profit. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Camara A.; Goundan A.; Henning C.; Savard L.; Beye A.,Tactical,10.1108/JADEE-08-2021-0201,Agricultural market participation; Farm household model; Multinomial endogenous switching regression,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study offers insights into market participation strategies for farmers, which aligns with tactical decisions that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets focused on maximizing profits.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Joint market participation choices of smallholder farmers and households’ welfare: evidence from Senegal,2023
"University students in China are increasingly embracing the use of celebrity endorsement in teaching. Celebrities are now able to rapidly and easily reach a huge audience because of the growth of social media platforms like WeChat, Weibo, and Douyin, which makes them an appealing marketing tool for educational institutions. The potential advantages of leveraging celebrity endorsements to advertise their programs and draw students have been acknowledged by educational institutions in China. In addition to examining educational celebrity endorsement and educational purchase intention attainment, the study examines students' desire to act as moderators and planned behavior theory in Chinese universities. 440 students from various Chinese universities participated in an online and in-person survey that collected the data for the analysis. According to the findings of structural equation modeling (SEM), teaching strategies have a positive impact on students' desires. The study's results also showed a connection between achieving educational purchase intentions and celebrity endorsement of educational products, student consumer choice, and student desire. Cross-sectional analysis, close-ended questions, and quantitative research are all used in the current study. In light of this, it is deemed crucial to use creative and engaging teaching strategies in the higher education sector. Educational institutions can create marketing plans that boost students' purchasing intentions and enrollment levels by focusing on attitudes, arbitrary standards, and perceived behavioral control. To demonstrate the relationships between the constructs under consideration, future research on this topic should involve longitudinal or field testing. There are major policy recommendations, calls for future research, and recommended theoretical and practical implications. © 2023, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

"The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, the paper calls attention to a unique subset of professional service providers (PSPs) who have obvious product expertise related to their profession yet are only minimally involved in the sales process. Despite this, they are considerably influential in regard to their clients’ brand decision-making process. Examples of these include veterinarians recommending a given pet food brand and dentists recommending a brand of dental floss. Secondly, since environmental sustainability is an important facet of corporate social responsibility, we considered factors that help predict PSPs’ propensity to recommend environmentally friendly brands to their clientele.The conceptual model argues that PSPs’ degree of identification with their profession, self-assessed knowledge in environmental concerns and expectation that sustainable brands will engage in eco-based marketing are all positive influences on PSPs’ likelihood to recommend sustainable brands and generate positive word of mouth. Responses from 467 veterinarians, representing this unique class of PSPs were analysed, and structural equation modelling determined that identification with the profession was a motivating factor in learning more about sustainability. In turn, self-assessed expertise in environmental issues was shown to increase the likelihood that PSPs would recommend sustainable brands. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.",Stoica M.; Hickman T.M.,Out of scope,,brand recommendation; corporate social responsibility; professional service provider; social identity theory; sustainability; word of mouth,0.0,,5,85,Henry Stewart Publications,"The abstract primarily discusses professional service providers (PSPs) in contexts such as veterinary and dental services, focusing on their influence on brand recommendations and environmental sustainability.

"The power that default options have in shaping choice has been well established, yet relatively little is known about how decision makers experience and interpret such preselected options. Research suggests that individuals assume defaults represent a recommended course of action, yet the basis for this recommendation is unclear. Across two experimental studies, we explored consumer theories of default recommendations, examining spontaneous and experimentally manipulated perceptions of the basis of the default, and the impact on decision making across different contexts. Evidence across diverse populations and tasks shows that options were retained to a greater extent when represented as the default, consistent with classic default effects. Furthermore, a significant default effect emerged when the decision context was framed as complex. In line with research on social influence, defaults were most effective when they were presumed to reflect the most popular option (regardless of context). Interestingly, participants rated defaults as being more likely to represent the most popular option, regardless of decision context or default explanation provided to them. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the contexts in which default choices are relied upon and how those defaults are perceived by decision makers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Buchanan T.M.; Buchanan J.; Diedericks D.; Davis L.,Operational,10.1111/ijcs.12847,decision making; default; nudge; perceptions; social psychology,5.0,,60,5,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study focuses on how default options influence consumer decision-making, which relates to managing consumer preferences and choices, indicative of operational decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,I'll have what she's having: (Social) Perceptions of default options and implications for marketing and decision making,2023

"The present study attempted to determine the elements affecting users' opinions about using electronic auctions in Jordan. The study's target audience was Jordanian university students. We ran-domly selected 600 students from three public universities in Jordan after 600 users from each of the three universities responded to the surveys. The primary data for this study were gathered using a specially created questionnaire that was based on earlier research. SEM software (smart PLS 4.0.8.3) was employed in the evaluation of data. This study looked into the factors that led Jordanians to use electronic auctions and found four indirect significant relationships and ten direct significant relationships. First, user attitudes and independent variables (usefulness, aware-ness, ease of use, and techno trust) are directly significant antecedents of utilizing e-auctions in Jordan. The use of e-auctions is related to the independent variable in five direct and significant ways: usefulness, awareness, ease of use, digital divide, and techno trust. Thirdly, there are direct and statistically significant correlations between user attitudes and the independent variables (use-fulness, awareness, ease of use, and techno trust). Fourthly, there appears to be a clear and significant link between user attitudes and the intention to use e-auctions. Fifth, there are four mediated meaningful indirect correlations between the intention to use e-auctions and the independent var-iable. The findings of the current study are based on a number of factors that affect the demand for e-commerce in Jordan. They also include some recommendations for academics and decision-makers in e-marketing affairs. The current study also contributes in identifying challenges and suggestions that would overcome obstacles related to shopping operations through e-auctions. The factors examined in this study have been the subject of prior research.

"Data analytics plays a significant role within the context of the digital business landscape, particularly concerning online sales, aiming to enhance understanding of customer behaviors in the online realm. We review the recent perspectives and empirical findings from several years of scholarly investigation. Furthermore, we propose combining computational methods to scrutinize online customer behavior. We apply the decision tree construction, GUHA (General Unary Hypotheses Automaton) association rules, and Formal concept analysis for the input dataset of 9123 orders (transactions) of sports nutrition, healthy foods, fitness clothing, and accessories. Data from 2014 to 2021, covering eight years, are employed. We present the empirical discoveries, engage in a critical discourse concerning these findings, and delineate the constraints inherent in the research process. The decision tree for classification of the year’s fourth quarter implies that the most important attributes are country, gross profit category, and delivery. The classification of the morning time implies that the most important attributes are gender and country. Thus, the potential marketing strategies can include heterogeneous conditions for men and women based on these findings.

"The value chain for jumbo squid fishery encompasses a process of linking multiple components and actors that generate and promote capitalization of the added value of this fishery product. This study aims to diagnose the value chain for jumbo squid in Mexico using the structural analysis approach, allowing a description of the main actors, and their interactions with the markets, socioeconomic drivers, as well as the influence of different variables in the performance of jumbo squid chain value. The results derived from the structural analysis, six variables (related to the transformation, marketing, and consumption activities) and two actors (producers and academic research) were identified as the most relevant. The competitive advantages and added value could be reached by integrating the aspects related to the most relevant variables and taking appropriate decisions to deal with situations of uncertainty, which can promote weak nodes in the value chain, primarily because of the failures in the commercialization and consumption of jumbo squid. This suggests that efforts should not be concentrated on a single node but should be addressed jointly. Considering that the jumbo squid value chain currently depends on the changing conditions of the fishery, which is marked by production instability, causing uncertainty in the subsequent nodes; the status indicates that a restructuring of the value chain is evident since the market is prone to dismantling or self-regulation over the medium term. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Cruz-Escalona V.H.; Moncaleano-Rubio Y.A.; Morales-Bojórquez E.; Arizmendi-Rodríguez D.I.; Pérez-Palafox X.A.; Ornelas-Vargas A.; Payán-Alcacio J.Á.; Urcádiz-Cazares F.J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.marpol.2024.106099,"MACTOR method; Matrix of Alliances and Conflicts, Tactics, Objectives and Recommendations; Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification; MICMAC method; MORPHOL method; Structural analysis",5.0,,10,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the value chain for jumbo squid fishery, focusing on long-term goals, competitive advantages, and the integration of various actors and factors within the fishery system.

Findings: The results showed that MTE has a significant influence on ATT which further influences RCI (a dimension of behavioral intention-BI) of visitors towards a religious destination. Further, MRE mediates the relationship between MTE and ATT. Nevertheless, REL illustrated a significant moderation influence on the relationship between MRE and ATT, further verifying the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL in the model. Practical implications: Recommendation of existing customers is one of the most powerful indicators of customer loyalty and usually leads to revisit. The research provides destination managers/tourism planners of pilgrimage sites to formulate appropriate marketing strategies to develop RCI and sustainable branding. Originality/value: This study adds to the empirical studies conducted on REL by constructing a composite picture of the memorable tourism experience within a pilgrimage tourism context. The uniqueness lies in the attempt to investigate the mediated moderation impact of MRE and REL using a symmetric (PLS-SEM) approach. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bhandari H.; Mittal A.; Arora M.,Tactical,10.1108/JHTI-11-2023-0848,Memorable religious experience; Memorable tourism experience; Pilgrimage; PLS-SEM; Recommend intention; Religiosity,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on understanding the relationship between memorable tourism experiences, attitudes towards pilgrimage, and recommendation intentions, which involves structured decision-making for marketing strategies.

"This study analyzed the perceived effects of COVID-19 on smallholder farmers’ agricultural production practices in the South Wollo and Oromo Administrative Zones of Ethiopia. Data were collected from 270 randomly selected respondents from September 5 to October 10, 2020. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The severity of problems is analyzed using a four-point Likert scale. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean and one sample t-test, while qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The one sample t-test result revealed that the respondents' level of agreement is statistically and significantly different from neutral in all cases at the 95 and 99% levels of confidence. These immediate problems caused the smallholder farmers to develop concerns about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Smallholder farmers in Jige faced challenges like a lack of markets, collaboration issues, delayed agricultural activities, spoilage of produce, labour issues, and increased input prices. The government and development practitioners should prioritize timely agricultural input delivery through cooperative unions, transfer of information and advisory services, and the marketing of agricultural products using alternative strategies.

"Social media influencers have become important motivators in shaping tourist attitudes and behaviors. This study analyzed how exposure to influencer content impacts key outcomes for the destination Jordan. A survey of tourists who visited Jordan in the past 3 years measured their perceptions of influencer credibility, content quality, awareness/interest, trust/engagement, destination image, general tourism behavior, and intentions to revisit. Results of SEM analysis found significant positive effects of influencer marketing on both destination image and visit intentions. Awareness/interest and trust/engagement were most impactful, highlighting influencers' role in sparking early motivation. Content quality additionally predicted visit intentions by informing decisions. Perceived credibility made recommendations more persuasive. Furthermore, usage intensity positively moderated the mediated relationships, amplifying effects among heavy social media users. Findings provide theoretical validation of how influencers act as digital opinion leaders. By enhancing destination image through compelling portrayals, influencers shape audience travel interests and behaviors. Managerial implications suggest destinations should invest in influencer campaigns for reach and inspiration while ensuring content quality. Performance tracking informs optimal platform and demographic targeting. Overall, influencer marketing demonstrated significant persuasive appeal for potential tourists. This quantitative study pioneer’s measurement of influencer marketing's tangible impacts on key tourist metrics. The results empirically substantiate the ability of strategically leverage influencers to motivate visitation and guide decisionmaking.

"Purpose: This article investigates how medical specialists as professionals and elective cosmetic surgery tourists as consumers relationally negotiate decisions within the cosmetic surgery clinic. Drawing on a Goffmanian approach, this article explores the processual social structures that shape consumer logics in the clinic as a social space and as a type of professional institution. Design/methodology/approach: This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork in cosmetic surgery clinics in South Korea. Findings: This article identifies two genres of professional strategies (spatial arrangements and dramaturgical performances) that are leveraged by medical specialists to assert control over and persuade consumers to purchase cosmetic surgery. Research limitations/implications: The valorization of surgery captured in this article suggests that surgical modifications may serve as another vehicle for entrenching class inequality between those able and those unable to afford surgery. Practical implications: This article offers recommendations for future policymaking in terms of the regulatory oversight of the consumer profiles eligible for surgery and the marketing practices of clinics.

"In 2018, a multisite case study investigated the agricultural challenges faced by Maldivian farmers and farming stakeholders. The study interviewed a total of 373 farmers and stakeholders from 51 islands across 15 atolls. In their own words, farmers and stakeholders identified factors in macro and micro levels agricultural systems that are related to poor connectivity between farmers and the markets. This research article conducts a deeper investigation into these factors using the Ecological Systems Theory. In this investigation, the data clearly reveal that any efforts towards market connectivity resolution must address the individual within the context of the greater, extrinsic challenges present in the interrelated systems of farming in the Maldives. While the individual is placed at the smallest level of a greater system, and the interconnections of the larger systems are great in impact, the individual is ultimately the decision maker on what and how things work, and how effective they will be. In this article, five recommendations are identified to enhance farmers’ connectivity to markets.

"In the post-pandemic landscape, scant research has been conducted on the timely, in-depth examination of how food-related attributes affect tourist food choices. To tackle this issue, this study employed a discrete choice experiment and latent class nested logit models for a nuanced exploration of tourist food preferences. This approach captured both tourists’ preference heterogeneity and substitution effects among fast, local, and hometown-style food options. Findings reveal that price, food taste rating, waiting time, service, and environment are key determinants of tourists’ food choices. Our model identified two distinct tourist classes, Local-food-image class and Anti-price-quality class, each displaying unique food preferences and substitution patterns.

"Today, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is considered one of tourism businesses’ most effective forms of communication. Using eWOM on social media as an alternative decision aid can benefit consumers. This study examines the information adoption model to determine how consumers adopt eWOM on Instagram, and the subsequent influence on their travel behaviour. This study identifies the need for information as a predictor of information usefulness, converted to adoption and visit intentions. To test the research hypotheses, 263 respondents who had visited destinations based on eWOM recommendations on Instagram participated in the experiment. The data were analysed using a structural equation modelling approach using Smart-PLS 3.0. The findings indicate that the need for information is the most significant factor affecting the usefulness of the information. Furthermore, source credibility and argument quality are critical factors in enhancing the information’s usefulness. Thus, this study has significantly contributed to the theory by adding the need of information to predict visit intentions in the IAM model. Consumers are more likely to adopt high-quality information and convert it into a visit intention. This study provides practical guidelines for tourism managers who wish to utilise social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) as marketing communication tools to encourage eWOM about their destinations. © 2023 The Author(s).

"– General societal developments show that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about lasting changes in attitudes towards education and lifestyle, among others. The presented study aims to verify, using a quantitative questionnaire survey method on a sample of 500 respondents each, whether there have been changes in the preferences of potential students at a selected university in the Czech Republic between pre-Covid (2017) and post-Covid (2022) years. Current studies show that the post-COVID decision-making process is, among other things, generally more affected by the relationships with family and friends. Also, the paper’s goal is to verify whether this fact also applies to the area of preferences of university applicants and whether it is differentiated by gender. Based on the statistical testing and interpretation of the data, recommendations will be formulated for the marketing management of universities concerning how to adapt to changes in the preferences of applicants and how to effectively adjust the communication mix and message to the given target group, thereby increasing its interest in studying at the university. The proposed measures will thus contribute to increasing the competitiveness of universities, as they identify opportunities to target potential students more effectively. © 2024 Martina Juříková, Josef Kocourek & Eliška Káčerková; published by UIKTEN.

"Purpose: Over the past 20 years, partial least squares (PLS) has become a popular method in marketing research. At the same time, several methodological studies have demonstrated problems with the technique but have had little impact on its use in marketing research practice. This study aims to present some of these criticisms in a reader-friendly way for non-methodologists. Design/methodology/approach: Key critiques of PLS are summarized and demonstrated using existing data sets in easily replicated ways. Recommendations are made for assessing whether PLS is a useful method for a given research problem. Findings: PLS is fundamentally just a way of constructing scale scores for regression. PLS provides no clear benefits for marketing researchers and has disadvantages that are features of the original design and cannot be solved within the PLS framework itself. Unweighted sums of item scores provide a more robust way of creating scale scores. Research limitations/implications: The findings strongly suggest that researchers abandon the use of PLS in typical marketing studies. Practical implications: This paper provides concrete examples and techniques to practicing marketing and social science researchers regarding how to incorporate composites into their work, and how to make decisions regarding such. Originality/value: This work presents a novel perspective on PLS critiques by showing how researchers can use their own data to assess whether PLS (or another composite method) can provide any advantage over simple sum scores. A composite equivalence index is introduced for this purpose. © 2022, Mikko Rönkkö, Nick Lee, Joerg Evermann, Cameron McIntosh and John Antonakis.",Rönkkö M.; Lee N.; Evermann J.; McIntosh C.; Antonakis J.,Not identified,10.1108/EJM-02-2021-0099,Composites; Measurement; Model testing; Partial least squares; Structural equation models; Theory testing,70.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract presents a critique of a specific statistical method (PLS) used in marketing research without making clear strategic, tactical, or operational implications.

"Esports, competitive video gaming competitions, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, with their growth in emerging markets contingent on local area network (LAN) gaming centers. LAN gaming centers are integral in emerging economies as they provide access to gaming technology and infrastructure that may be otherwise unavailable. Given their importance, the purpose of our study is to identify characteristics relevant to LAN gaming center operations within the context of an emerging market. We conducted a two-phase, multimethod analysis of LAN gaming centers in Iran, an emerging yet dynamic market. In the first phase, we used a balanced scorecard (BSC) approach to identify business factors salient to LAN gaming center operations. In the second phase, we collected data from LAN gaming center consumers (N = 330) to rank the factors by importance using a multi attribute decision-making (MADM) model. We found that business factors relevant to LAN gaming centers operations include: offering a variety of services, providing attractive and modern facilities, employing sports marketing methods, monitoring competition, and developing multiple streams of revenue. via the BSC, our research offers strategic recommendations for LAN gaming centers. LAN gaming centers provide access to modern gaming technology and help consumers overcome technological limitations by providing a physical space for esports.

"Purpose: This study explores the mediating effects of relationship marketing orientation (RMO) and service quality orientation (SQO) on market orientation, selling orientation, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services. Additionally, it offers important recommendations for non-life insurers in Taiwan for policy development and improving policyholder retention. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of policyholders belonging to the top five non-life insurance companies in Taiwan. The data were then analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings: RMO and SQO mediate the effects of the salesperson’s market orientation on policyholder retention. Thus, RMO and SQO are key factors influencing policyholder retention. Consequently, high levels of market orientation should be maintained to increase RMO and SQO, strengthening the retention rate of non-life insurance policyholders. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature. In the future, researchers should collect data from other countries and service industries (e.g. banks, securities, and other financial institutions), expand to different insurance contexts (e.g. life insurance), and conduct longitudinal studies or experimental research. Practical implications: The results of this study can act as a guide for providers of non-life insurance services. Based on the research results, we recommend decision-makers pay increased attention to increasing policyholder retention rates by strengthening their firm’s RMO and SQO. Originality/value: Few studies have investigated the relationships among market orientation, selling orientation, RMO, SQO, and policyholder retention in non-life insurance services within Asian contexts in general and specifically in Taiwan.

"Purpose: Second-order system-dynamics engineering (SOSDE) involves constructing and running enterprise manufacturing simulation models with new proposals for operational processes, byproducts, supply chain and/or downstream marketing designs. This paper aims to describe sustainability the principal lessons from enacting SOSDE research for achieving goals in large manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a case research commentary in the agricultural industry that contributes abductively derives six principal lessons from SOSDE research on introducing sustainability-focused manufacturing and product innovations. Operational processes in large-scale poultry processing plants in an emerging market represent the specific industry and firm domain of this case study. Alternative SOSDE simulation models of decisions, materials flow and outcomes with versus without operational innovations were constructed following one-to-one interviews with experienced farm managers and entrepreneurs. Findings: The principles demonstrate how large farms in a developing nation (i.e. Bangladesh) go about adopting radically innovative manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations to improve traditional operations. This study confirms and expands on the general observation that SOSDE can help achieve sustainability and environmental, social and governance goals, contribute new value outcomes by converting unused production wastes into valuable byproducts and introduce design efficiencies in production, supply chain and marketing processes. SOSDE complements, while being a revolutionary departure from, “six sigma management programs” that focus on achieving exceptional and near mistake-free manufacturing operations. Both represent distinct philosophies and sets of actions that sometimes can conflict with one another. Embracing both successfully in the same enterprise is a goal that may appear unreachable, seemingly impossible to achieve and yet represents a manufacturing/marketing epitome that is observable in exceptional enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This paper may generate controversy as well as advance interest in applying SOSDE in introductions of improved manufacturing, supply chain and marketing operations aiming to accomplish radical improvements in sustainability goals. Practical implications: This commentary describes how using SOSDE and running alternative production simulations with versus without including superior, radically new, process innovations enable the firm to find and eliminate glitches in system changes and reduce the fear associating with breakdowns and financial losses due to inadequate knowledge of operating new industrial procedures and outcomes. Social implications: Introductions of superior radically new innovations in industrial manufacturing and marketing via SOSDE frequently include manufacturing firms embracing new environment sustainability objectives and additional marketable byproducts from the firm's main productions lines. This commentary offers details on how this process is enacted in poultry manufacturing in an economically emerging nation.

"This study aimed to examine the impact of augmented reality (AR) on the purchasing behavior of Saudi customers using analytic–descriptive methods and data from a snowball sample of 812 online buyers. Positive correlations were found between AR factors (hermeneutic, embodiment, and background) and dimensions (quality, fun, and creativity) and the purchase experience. Young women aged 17–26 mainly use AR for buying clothes and accessories, and the majority of the sample shops are available locally through mobile apps. The findings indicate that AR has a significant influence on buying decisions and suggest its potential use in marketing communications. The results also reveal that gender, social status, education level, and monthly income have an impact on participants’ responses to AR, with women and those who are married having more favorable views. Clothing and accessories were found to be the most frequently purchased products through AR. There were no significant differences based on age or the number of family members. Participants reported positively about their AR experience, and their concerns and anxiety did not affect their purchasing experience. Based on the main study’s results, a number of recommendations can be made: Saudi businesses need to use AR in their marketing communication strategies to meet consumer needs and trends. To maximize the benefits of brand awareness, they should use AR techniques and adopt this technology for products that depend on design in their production. When using AR in general and in light of the theories that have been studied, it is important to think about the cultural traits and dimensions of Saudi consumers and conduct further exploratory research before implementation. © 2023 by the author.",AL Hilal N.S.H.,Tactical,10.3390/su15065448,advertising; augmented reality (AR); marketing communications; online buying; purchasing decisions,5.0,,15,0,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The study examines specific factors influencing the purchasing behavior of Saudi customers through augmented reality (AR), which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to offer a conceptual model that bridges gaps in the current research by combining constructs from the health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Furthermore, the researchers applied the constructed model to analyse the determinants of workers’ intentions to use e-wallet payment options for business transactions rather than physical currency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the paper examines whether there are any significant variations in the usage intentions of Ghanaian workers in the formal and informal sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The non-probability convenience sampling technique was used to compile the primary respondents among Ghanaian users of e-wallets. Based on constructs derived from the HBM and TPB, an online survey involving the use of a questionnaire was administered to collect quantitative data from 285 formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Data collected was analysed using the partial least squares-structural equation modelling approach involving the measurement, structural model tests, hypothesis tests and multi-group analysis (MGA) tests. Findings: This study reveals that workers’ attitudes, subjective norms and perceived susceptibility as the main determinants of intentions to use e-wallets, as the analysis of data lends support to hypotheses involving these constructs. Perceived behavioural control was however not supported by the data analysis as a determinant of workers’ intention. Finally, there were no significant differences between e-wallet usage intentions of formal and informal sector workers in Ghana. Research limitations/implications: Given the ongoing pandemic, the study recommends that governments of emerging economies should formulate policies that promote the use of e-wallets, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and at the same time contribute to the quest for a cashless economy. However, the results of the study are only based on data collected from workers in Ghana. Therefore, practitioners should apply the recommendations with discretion and make modifications where necessary. The results of the study also provide evidence from the context of a developing country that can support future academic pursuits. Practical implications: This study provides evidence that influences practitioners’ decisions and practices regarding the design and implementation of e-wallet services and innovations among workers in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Originality/value: This study provides useful business insights to user acquisition managers, marketing managers and business development managers during the formulation of policies, strategies and approaches for their mobile wallet subscriber base. Moreover, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to apply the constructs of the HBM (mainly applied in health research) to the study of workers’ intentions to use e-wallets. It, therefore, makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by examining the combined effects of the constructs of the HBM and the TPB on workers’ intention to use e-wallets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Amankwa E.; Amissah G.; Okoampa-Larbi R.,Tactical,10.1108/JSTPM-09-2021-0137,Attitude; Cashless economy; COVID-19; E-wallet; Intentions; Mobile money; Perceived severity; Perceived susceptibility; Subjective norm; Theory of planned behaviour,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a conceptual model to analyze the determinants of workers' intentions to use e-wallets, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on specific targets and structured approaches to user engagement and technology adoption.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Cashless economy – the nexus of COVID-19 and E-wallet usage intentions: a multi-group analysis between formal and informal sector workers in Ghana,2023
"Research purpose. The main goal of the article is to determine the current level of financial literacy among clients of the selected bank in Slovakia. This finding will be compared with the average level in the country. In the survey, we focused on determining their financial literacy level. Currently, a lot of attention is paid to the issue of financial literacy. In connection with financial literacy, a lot is said about education. Therefore, in the paper, we focused on finding out the relationship between financial literacy and the level of education as such. We also compared the financial literacy of the survey sample with the overall financial literacy in Slovakia. Design / Methodology / Approach. For the purposes of this article, an anonymous online questionnaire survey focused on the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank was conducted. By analysing theoretical knowledge and existing surveys, we established hypotheses, which we subsequently verified statistically. When analysing theoretical knowledge and surveys in the Slovak Republic, we found that there is a large number of surveys focused on financial literacy. The output and support of each of them are primarily focused on increasing financial literacy through education. We, therefore, assumed, given that financial literacy has been in the curriculum of primary and secondary schools for several years, that financial literacy is related to the availability of goods. We also assumed that financial literacy in the Slovak Republic is increasing. To verify the hypothesis, we used two statistical methods - the Chi-Square test and the Mean Congruence Test. The reason for choosing customers of a specific bank for the purposes of our survey was the number of respondents' answers. We managed to collect the most answers for the bank mentioned. Findings. Through the selected statistical method, we found that in our survey, the number of correct answers is not affected by the level of education. It was also interesting to find that the level of financial literacy of the selected region in 2022 is not higher than the overall level of financial literacy of the Slovak Republic determined on the basis of a survey from 2012. Originality / Value / Practical implications. The proposals and recommendations that emerged from the survey relate to increasing the financial literacy of customers of the selected bank. We focused our recommendations on education and conducting surveys, both for customers and for the bank's management. The bank can use these recommendations as a basis for managerial decisions. It is necessary to increase the financial literacy of customers. It is also necessary to support the field of marketing, especially communication with customers. It is only up to the management of the bank to decide which customers it will have and how it will retain or expand them.  © 2023 Eva Kicova et al.",Kicova E.; Ponisciakova O.; Rosnerova Z.,Out of scope,10.2478/jec-2023-0008,Customer; Financial literacy; Management; Managerial decision-making,,10.0,0,90,Sciendo,"The article focuses on assessing financial literacy among bank clients in Slovakia, which falls under financial services rather than marketing-related applications.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Financial Literacy of Customers of the Selected Slovak Bank as a Basis for Managerial Decision-Making,2023
"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the comparative importance of factors influencing the customer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking for consumer finance in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: First, a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature was conducted to identify a broad range of factors related to customer shift behavior. Through an expert sampling, 14 essential factors were chosen for further investigation. Second, a questionnaire was developed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). This questionnaire was then distributed among customers who had previously been using conventional banking services but had made a shift toward Islamic banking. The purpose of this questionnaire was to gather data and insights regarding their motivations and decision-making process behind the shift, and a sample 215 customers are taken in the study. Findings: The results of AHP depicts that the religiosity is a most important factor influencing customers to shift from conventional to Islamic banking, and the second most important factor is pricing. The other subsequent important factors are reputation of the bank, marketing and promotion, service quality, behavior of banks staff, Shariah compliance, management, convenience, fastness and charges/fees. Whereas documentation, ambiance and recommendation are found least important factors to patronize Islamic banking. Practical implications: The study recommends Islamic banks to create awareness, concentrating on religious factor to have a greater impact on growth of Islamic banking and shrinking of conventional banking. Further, it suggests Islamic banks to apply Shariah-recommended approach of doing business, to help community in best possible way and to launch differentiated marketing techniques to attract customers. It also proposes regulatory authorities to provide facilitation to Islamic banking business by providing level playing field similar to conventional banking, tax equality and conversion of public financing from conventional banking to Islamic banking. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its comprehensive analysis of factors influencing consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking in the context of consumer finance in Pakistan. By using the AHP, the study provides a structured approach to understanding the relative importance of these factors. This is the uniqueness of the paper that it applies the AHP for the analysis. Furthermore, the study offers practical implications for Islamic banks and regulatory authorities to effectively address and capitalize on this consumer shift trend. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ahmad M.; Zafar M.B.; Perveen A.,Strategic,10.1108/JIMA-02-2023-0036,AHP; Bank selection criteria; Consumer shift; Decision-making; Islamic banking; Islamic consumer finance; Pakistan,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on the long-term factors influencing customer behavior in the context of banking, aiming to define the strategic goals for Islamic banking growth in Pakistan.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,Consumer shift behavior from conventional to Islamic banking: decision-making analysis through AHP,2024

"First Nations peoples have the right to participate in all decisions affecting them. This includes food policy decision-making. In the Australian state of Victoria, the Food Policies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (FoodPATH) project aimed to determine the food policy actions that are likely to be effective and acceptable for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. Community-based workshops were held with six Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisations (ACCOs) in urban and regional Victoria during 2022. A team of at least three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander facilitators guided participants (n = 53) through a series of workshop activities using group model building methods. Group model building is a participatory systems science research method which enables community stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of the system-level drivers of complex problems and co-design actions to address them. Workshop discussions coincided with real-time creation of a visual system map of the interconnected determinants of food choice. Participants used these maps to develop and prioritise actions for improving food environments and nutrition in the community. Participants identified a diverse array of interconnected factors influencing food choice and nutrition in Aboriginal Communities across Victoria. Food access and affordability, junk food marketing, food knowledge and skills and diet and disease were common themes across all sites, while access to junk food, growing local food, traditional Aboriginal foods, and family, Community and culture were key themes in most sites. Results informed a Community-driven agenda, comprising five Community-led actions and five government policy recommendations for improving food environments and nutrition for Victorian Aboriginal Communities. © 2024 The Author(s)","Browne J.; Walker (Yorta Yorta) T.; Hill (Torres Strait Islander) K.; Mitchell (Mununjali) F.; Beswick H.; Thow (Pennemuker, Ngāti Porou) S.; Ryan (Gunditjmara) J.; Sherriff (Wotjobaluk) S.; Rossignoli A.; Ropitini (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Maniapoto) A.; Johnstone M.; Paradies (Wakaya) Y.; Backholer K.; Allender S.; Brown A.D.",Not identified,10.1016/j.foodpol.2024.102676,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; First Nations; Food environments; Food policy; Group model building; Systems thinking,50.0,,10,20,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses food policy actions and community engagement but does not align clearly with the definitions provided for strategic, tactical, or operational classifications.

"Purpose: High failure rates characterise the experience of new entrepreneurial ventures in Nigeria and other emerging economies. Reliance on strategic tools such as entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is critical to the growth and survival of new ventures. This empirical study aims to deepen the understanding of the relationship between EO and performance of new venture logistics firms in Nigeria. It further explores the contingent effects of social capital and marketing capabilities on the hypothesised direct relationships from a transport industry perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Managers of 650 new venture logistics service providers in selected Nigerian cities were Web-surveyed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Regression analysis was further performed. Common method variance and other validity checks were assessed. Findings: The 469 valid responses showed a positive relationship between EO and new venture performance (NVP). Social capital and marketing capabilities positively moderate the direct relationship between EO and NVP. Managerial implications suggest that context-specific dynamics must be considered when making strategic EO decisions to aid firm growth and survival. Originality/value: This study directly responds to the contingency approach recommendation of past studies (Anwar et al., 2022; Van Stel et al., 2021; Covin and Wales, 2019) using the logistics service and emerging economy context.

"Research on the role brand image plays in higher education (HE) suggests that it is crucial to understand students’ perceptions of their university. This study builds on existing empirical work by Alcaide-Pulido, Alves, and Gutierrez-Villar (2017) exploring themes of national and international recognition, economic value, university campus facilities, and external communications and values. It employs a structural equation modelling approach with Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Decision Trees Analysis through a sample of 624 undergraduate students from England, Spain, and Portugal. The findings highlight areas of commonality as well as differences between the different cultures and nationalities examined as part of the study. They show areas that brand managers from each country should concentrate on, making recommendations that could help to shape the marketing direction of universities in each of the nations included in the research. The English and Portuguese should prioritise communication to students through their institutional website, whereas Spaniards should attend to ethical values and social responsibility. Economic value is an aspect that Spanish and English universities should focus on. Spaniards and English agree that campus facilities are important, whereas class size is key for Portuguese.

"The study aims to discover the effect of marketing deception practised by mobile phone companies in after-sales services, whether they are providing guarantee services, after-sales service price, promotion or distribution regarding the decision for consumer purchase. A descriptive analytical method has been selected. Data was collected through a questionnaire that was distributed electronically to random individual samples, represented by graduate students in both the Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology for Post-graduate studies and the Higher Institute for Financial and Accounting Studies / University of Baghdad. The sample size consisted of (60) students while the data analysis showed that there is a correlation between marketing deception of after-sales service and consumer purchasing decision. Marketing deception related to price significantly affects consumer purchase decisions, however marketing deception in service, promotion and distribution does not significantly affect consumer sparks decision. This result is due to the nature of consumer culture, the studied sample and the extent of their understanding of the questions. Amongst the most important recommendations of the study is the necessity of working to activate the role of the Consumer Protection Association to monitor the market in the after-sales services sector by conducting awareness campaigns for consumers of their rights to enhance their ability to test the quality of services provided to them and impose penalties on marketing companies that demonstrate the practice of marketing deception in order to reduce unethical practices.  © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Al-Heali A.N.,Tactical,,Analytical study; Consumer purchasing decision; Marketing deception,5.0,,15,0,Primrose Hall Publishing Group,"The study provides insights into consumer behavior regarding after-sales services and marketing deception, which relates to structured decision-making in marketing practices.

"Britain’s scheduled exit from the European Union (‘Brexit’) has long-term ramifications for strategic marketing. Faced with new challenges and uncertainty, UK universities are increasingly looking beyond EU borders to recruit international students. In this context, we draw upon country-of-origin theory to categorise the factors that influence non-EU international student decisions to select an overseas study destination and institution. Based on the results of a survey with 317 Arab, Chinese, and Indian students attending UK universities, we identify eight factors that influence international student decisions to study in the UK (social safety, education quality, entry obstacles, environment, recommendations, knowledge of host country, work and immigration, and meeting new cultures).

"Market response models or marketing mix models quantify the effects of marketing actions on consumption-based outcomes such as sales and market share. They are frequently used in the business sector to help managers make effective resource allocation decisions, especially in the digital age. However, these models can also be used on social causes, in particular to gauge the efficacy of regulations on consumption levels that have social consequences.

"Regression analysis is a widely used modelling tool in business decision making. However, proper application of this methodology requires that certain assumptions, associated with the model, be satisfied. The assumption we focus on is the normality of the response variable, which is directly related to the assumption of normality of the error component. In a variety of fields in business, such as finance, marketing, information systems, operations, and healthcare, the selected dependent variable does not inherently have a normal distribution. In the regression context, where the model parameters and independent variables are assumed to be constant, the distribution of the random error component thus influences the distribution of the dependent variable. Here, we study the impact of symmetric and asymmetric error distributions on the performance of the estimated model parameters. To create robust estimates, through a process of trimming the response variable, we study the effectiveness of the trimmed estimators with respect to the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) via a simulation procedure. Accordingly, to minimise the ratio of the mean squared error of the trimmed estimator to that of the OLS, a recommendation is developed for the optimal trimming proportion. © Operational Research Society 2021.",Mitra A.; Kalgotra P.,Out of scope,10.1080/2573234X.2021.2007803,Analytics; kurtosis; mean square error; optimal trimming proportion; simulation; skewness; trimmed estimator,10.0,,10,60,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses regression analysis and statistical methods primarily applicable in various fields such as finance, marketing, operations, and healthcare, but does not directly relate to marketing decisions or strategic implementation in marketing contexts.",scopus-recommendation,10,10,Optimal trimming proportion in regression analysis for non-normal distributions,2022
"Purpose: Health systems are progressively stressed by health spending, which is partially explained by the increase in the cost of health technologies. Countries have defined processes to prioritize interventions to be covered. This study aims to compare for the first time health technology assessment (HTA) processes in Canada and Chile, to explain the factors driving these decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a health policy analysis comparing HTA processes in Canada and Chile. An analysis of publicly available documents in Canada (for CADTH) and Chile (for the Ministry of Health (MoH)) was carried out. A recognized political science framework (the 3-I framework) was used to explain the similarities and differences in both countries. The comparison of processes was disaggregated into eligibility and evaluation processes. Findings: CADTH has different programmes for different types of drugs (with two separate expert committees), whereas the MoH has a unified process. Although CADTH’s recommendations have a federal scope, the final coverage is a provincial decision. In Chile, the recommendation has a national scope. In both cases, past recommendations influence the scope of the evaluation. Pharmaceutical companies and patient associations are important interest groups in both countries. Whereas manufacturers and tumour groups are able to submit applications to CADTH, the Chilean MoH prioritizes applications submitted by patient associations. Originality/value: Institutions, interests and ideas play important roles in driving HTA decisions in Canada and Chile, which is demonstrated in this novel analysis.

"Hospitality and Tourism are among the fastest-growing sectors and the source of foreign exchange with indirect-direct employments for quite an appreciable number of economies worldwide. The nature of the sector provides an avenue towards regional development through entrepreneurship venture creations, value addition to the abandoned resources, and regeneration of abandon natural resources with new themes as a novel approach. Tourism currently in a paradigm shift as a comparative advantage of destination is becoming less important than a competitive advantage.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts. It analyzes the impact of religiosity in influencing consumer life decisions and behaviors. The proposed framework is based on the norm activation theory (NAT) with religiosity added to it based on the extant literature. The paper aims to provide implications for marketing researchers and practitioners derived from its analysis and propositions. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper proposes a model for marketing researchers to consider the role of religiosity as a cultural and psychological factor in influencing online collaborative consumption. The NAT is adopted as the base of the conceptual model. The model posits research propositions on the potential interaction of religiosity with existing relationships in the theory to predict online collaborative consumption behavior. Findings: The NAT is considered a prominent model in studying pro-environmental behaviors and it was adopted in various studies. Some researchers adopted the theory to study collaborative consumption as a pro-environmental behavior. Religiosity was found to significantly impact pro-environmental behaviors, but no research was found regarding its impact on collaborative consumption. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and implications to marketing practitioners about the role of religiosity in influencing collaborative consumption behavior. Originality/value: Although there were few research studies that exist in discussing the role of religiosity in explaining consumer behavior, it could be argued that this paper is the first of its kind, according to the best of the authors’ knowledge, that discusses the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption contexts through the use of NAT. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Abutaleb S.; El-Bassiouny N.M.; Hamed S.,Strategic,10.1108/JIMA-09-2019-0186,Collaborative consumption; Norm activation theory; Religiosity; Sharing economy,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the role of religiosity in online collaborative consumption, proposing a framework that influences consumer behavior and marketing strategies.

"Purpose: This investigation builds on two domains. First, professional service providers, such as dentists and veterinarians, represent an understudied link in the distribution channel. Their recommendation of products, such as toothpaste and pet food, are impactful to their clientele. Second, for consumers, sustainability is growing as a motivating factor in product consideration. Consequently, brands committed to sustainability want to promote their products accordingly to connect with the consumer. The purpose of this study is to determine how to trust in sustainable brands is built in the mind of professional service providers, as they are influential in their clients’ decision process. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the conceptual model that predicted how brand trust of sustainable products is built in the mind of the professional service provider using a sample of 457 veterinarians. Findings: Results revealed that trust in sustainable brands is built via professionals’ expertise in sustainability and their perception of the importance of sustainability. Additionally, the perception of altruistic motivations had a positive impact on brand trust while the perception of strategic motivations had no influence on trust in sustainable brands. Originality/value: Previous studies typically examine sustainability in an organizational context or as a brand consideration factor for consumers.

"Background: The purpose of this study is to construct and validate a measurement model of women’s preferences in Obstetrician and Gynecologist (OB/GYN) selection in the private sector of non-clinical parameters. Methods: This methodological study included 462 respondents in OB/GYN’s offices to a researcher-made questionnaire. The patients visited 57 offices of OB/GYNs in the city of Mashhad in Iran and completed women’s preferences in OB/GYN selection questionnaire over a 2-month period from January to February 2018. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to verify the instrument’s construct validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the data fit our hypothesized model obtained from EFA model. Results: The first draft of the questionnaire was prepared with 118 items based on literature review. The outcome of content validity assessment was a 51-item questionnaire. Scale-Content Validity Index (S-CVI) turned out to be 0.80. The results of EFA yielded an instrument with 33 items in six domains, which explained 52.657% of the total variance of the questionnaire.

"Introduction. The discussion of the shaping of a digital image of university faculty member is driven by the need for effective educational interaction between students and faculty in the context of digitalization. However, there are practically no studies of the faculty’s image as a system, as well as technologies for modeling the faculty’s digital image. The objective of this study is to model faculty’s digital image for purposes of decision-making in the process of managing digital image in educational interactions. Materials and Methods. Secondary data were received through methods of content analysis and systemic and structural-functional evaluation of information. Primary data were obtained through comparative marketing study of faculty’s digital image on a sample of 400 students and 92 faculty members of a Moscow-based and a regional university and through an expert survey. Methods of multivariate scaling and analysis of statistically significant differences were also applied. Results. Novelty of the study lies in incorporating basic and instrumental core components in the model of university faculty’s digital image due to a dual role of “digital competence” element. The image modeling technique is also developed. It is noticed that faculty’s digital competence is not only an element in the structure of faculty’s image, but also a tool that transmits the image to external environment. Based on results of the study, recommendations on implementation of technique of faculty member’s digital image modeling are proposed. Revealed differences in opinions of students and faculty of two universities can be attributed to unequal access to digital technologies in different regions. Discussion and Conclusion. Conclusions made by authors contribute to development of scientific thought on shaping and promotion of university faculty’s digital image. Results of the comparative study will enable the Moscow-based and regional universities faculty to differentiate and precisely approach issues of shaping and promoting personal digital image. © 2022 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

"The purpose of this research is to determine how local businesses located in the small, unincorporated, rural community of Castroville in the central coast of California, USA, can innovate to achieve greater market success by reducing community monetary leakage. The source of this community monetary leakage is thought to be outshopping. This study found that outshopping by Castroville residents in communities adjacent to Castroville is responsible for a significant percentage of Castroville's residents' weekly expenditures. Recommendations based on the results of this research include making desired products available in Castroville and pricing them at a level that is clearly within the purchasing power of the Castroville residents. For Castroville residents who work out of the community, desired products must be made available in Castroville for purchase at times of the day and during the days of the week in which these residents can shop in Castroville. Our research also shows that developing innovative newspaper advertisements and utilising marketing mechanisms that focus on special sales and point-of-purchase promotions related to these desired products can help increase Castroville market demand and success.

"The research study explored the role of Public Relations (PR) elements such as seminars and speeches, digital media in creating a positive corporate image and corporate identity and explored how selected private colleges in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe can leverage on publicity to boost students’ enrolment. Extant literature of PR was approached and the Hedging and Wedging theory of communication was used as the theoretical framework for the research. The researcher applied mixed-pluralist research approach, where the qualitative research design was nested into partially quantitative research design. Methodology applied was exploratory, deductively anchored on the critical analysis of the data and discussion of findings to arrive at an informed decision. A purposive sample of 300 students, 30 teachers, 10 college directors and 30 administrators and self-administered closed-ended questionnaires were used in different private colleges. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS version 6 software, was used to test the propositions. Major findings are that seminars and speeches are less frequently than other digital PR approaches done in private colleges and this can affect the students’ enrolment and survival of the former. Recommendations included the need to make an improvement on carrying out frequently on the seminars and speeches, so as to enhance public image of the former. Budgeting for the PR function in private colleges is crucial. Students need to be involved in the publicity activities of a private college. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Despite being recognised as a lucrative segment by the industry, multigenerational family vacation remains an under-researched area. This study explores Korean multigenerational family vacation decision making (FVDM). Using a neo-Confucian epistemology, this study contributes to the existing family tourism literature, which has mainly researched Western nuclear family holidays, by investigating how Korean multigenerational families resolve conflicts during the FVDM process. Data were collected from 14 Korean multigenerational families using focus groups, interviews and visual methods. The study reveals the influence of neo-Confucianism on FVDM communication and the conflict resolution strategies. The vertical communication across generations was guided by filial piety while the horizontal communication within the second generation demonstrates seniority- and male- oriented values. Given the communication patterns, each generation adopted conflict resolution strategies to maintain family harmony, which is a core value of neo-Confucianism. Recommendations are provided to tourism practitioners to develop tourism products and marketing strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Yang M.J.H.; Khoo-Lattimore C.; Yang E.C.L.,Not identified,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104076,Asian epistemology; Communication pattern; Conflict resolution strategy; Family holiday; Family vacation decision making; Multigenerational family vacation; Neo-confucianism,40.0,,10,25,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses multigenerational family vacation decision making in a cultural context, which does not clearly fit into any of the provided classifications related to strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decisions.

"This research investigates the influential factors impacting CDM among prospective online MBA students, using qualitative interviews. This research focus is contextualised with analysis on the CDM process and the disparity between UK and international students, to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the influential factors. The findings of this research point to accreditation, price and rankings having the most influence on CDM among prospective online MBA students. It suggests that the CDM process among international students is more extensive than among UK students. International students’ searches had a longer duration, compared more programme alternatives, favoured detailed information such as course content and marketing materials, and searches often culminated in an application to more than one university. Meanwhile, UK students were more influenced by outbound university phone communications, which the data imply is attributable to English being their first language. Concluding practical recommendations include marketing messaging optimisation, strategic focus on rankings, accreditation and pricing and driving brand loyalty among prospective international students. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Jeckells H.,Tactical,10.1080/08841241.2020.1868038,consumer decision-making; Higher Education; Marketing; MBA; online Education,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,The research provides practical recommendations for optimizing marketing messaging and strategies to influence prospective online MBA students' decision-making.

"Purpose: This study aims to capture the views of executives about the merit of using the two segmentation approaches (quantitative vs qualitative). Furthermore, this study aimed to examine costs and benefits for two different segmentation approaches, using a minimax simple cost-benefit analysis (CBA) matrix. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 16 semistructured interviews were conducted with executives within the University of Sharjah (UoS). Furthermore, a minimax approach was applied to the CBA study. Findings: Evidence in this study found that the financial cost of quantitative segmentation approaches was higher than qualitative approaches. However, the decision-makers trusted the quantitative approach more regardless of the incurred costs. The study also found that there was a limited knowledge about social marketing and segmentation among executives. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study relate to the methodology applied, the sample selected and the lead research. Another factor is selection bias, which limited this study to one organization’s executives. It is conceivable that middle-level management would have had the desire to participate because they make the recommendations to top management in decision-making. The researcher did not collect precise data on time taken to design, implement and analyses the two segmentation studies, which qualified the precision of the CBA. Also, the fact that the sample includes participants from a relatively narrow range of disciplines should be noted as a limitation of the study. Practical implications: The current study provides a case study demonstrating how CBA provides a dollar amount estimate permitting alternate segmentation approaches to be compared and contrasted, assisting in the value estimation of any social marketing project. Social implications: The paper draws upon two streams of the literature: social marketing and CBA. The paper focused on the understanding of the literature, CBA offers a technique applicable to demonstrating cost savings that can be derived from choosing one method over another. Moreover, CBA assists in understanding the benefits or potential opportunity cost both financially and nonfinancially. Originality/value: This paper presents one of the first studies conducting a CBA to compare and contrast two segmentation approaches in social marketing. The study provides interesting insights into the perceptions of management executives over alternative research methods, although the results are limited to a case study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ibrahim A.; Rundle-Thiele S.; Knox K.; Almestarihi R.,Strategic,10.1108/JSOCM-01-2022-0026,Costs-benefit analysis; Qualitative segmentation; Quantitative segmentation; Social marketing,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study addresses the long-term implications of segmentation approaches in social marketing, examining the benefits and costs of these methods which aligns with strategic decision-making processes.",scopus-recommendation,60,25,The relative merit of two segmentation approaches: executives views and a cost-benefit analysis,2022
"Background: Competitive forces influence social marketing efforts. Indeed, social marketers often find themselves “shadow boxing” various forms of competition throughout their interventions. Despite the seminal role of competition as a threat to social marketing intervention efficacy, few empirical studies have undertaken competitive analysis or compared the usefulness of competitive typologies. Thus, this paper proposes an index approach to categorize competitive typologies relevant to a specific social marketing intervention in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability to the broader social cause domain. The proposed index approach is illustrated with empirical data, undertaking a competitive analysis of forces obstructing efforts to address educational inequality in Australia, then comparing the ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability of 15 competitive typologies noted in the social marketing literature to produce a competitor analysis index. Research Question: Which competitive typologies most effectively frame forces that inhibit educational equality social marketing efforts in Australia? Methods: Via interviews and focus groups, qualitative data were collected from 46 students from low socioeconomic status (LSES) backgrounds at six universities and sought to understand the influence of their home residence’s geographical remoteness on their university participation. The analysis revealed eight participant-identified differential competitors experienced by students from regional, rural and remote settings (LSES-R, n = 25, 54.4%) that were not experienced by those from metropolitan areas (LSES-M, n = 21, 45.6%). Fifteen competitive typologies were identified in the social marketing literature, and their capacity to frame these eight differential forces in terms of their ease of use, intuitiveness and generalisability was critiqued. Findings: Unlike their metropolitan counterparts, LSES-R participants experienced situational (n = 3), dispositional (n = 3) and goal pursuit (n = 2) competitive forces. The most effective competition typologies comprised two classification options that were distinctly different and could classify both the unfriendly and friendly competition that exists in social marketing. Five competitor typologies were identified as easy to use, intuitive and generalizable to the broader educational inequality domain. Together, these five competitor typologies form a competitor analysis index for educational inequality researchers and practitioners to enhance their intervention efficacy. Recommendations: Despite widespread agreement as to the importance of competitor analysis in social marketing, the efficacy of various typologies has received little attention. Social marketers are encouraged to critique competitor typologies before selecting those which enable effective decision-making. Furthermore, it is recommended that social marketers use a competitor analysis index comprised of multiple typologies to better capture the nebulous nature of the many different types of competitors that exist in a specific social marketing context. Limitations: The educational inequalities cause and qualitative method may constrain generalisability, but they exemplify the importance of competition typology choice and model how competitor analysis indexes can be developed. © The Author(s) 2021.",Raciti M.M.,Strategic,10.1177/15245004211031872,competition; educational inequality; regional; typologies; university; widening participation,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the development of a competitor analysis index for social marketing interventions, which involves long-term planning and understanding competitive forces in the context of addressing educational inequality.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of e-resources by the Faculty of Law’s academic staff at the University of Namibia’s (UNAM’s) main campus. The study aimed to determine their level of awareness of electronic resources (e-resources) available to them, how useful and effective they found these e-resources, and the challenges they face in accessing them. Design/methodology/approach: A convenient sampling technique was used to select a sample of 12 law academics from the population of 17. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methods using questionnaires and a semi-structured interview guide. Findings: Findings revealed that the majority of the law academics were aware of the e-resources subscribed by UNAM’s library, although some were not aware of the newly subscribed international law databases. The findings further revealed that the academics used e-resources for research, publications and teaching purposes, but irregular training, bandwidth problems and limited searching skills hindered their use of e-resources. Practical implications: Findings could be used to inform future collection-development decisions, realignment of information-literacy training and promotion and marketing of library services.

"Successful marketing efforts and professional sales encounters often depend on consumer involvement in the purchase decision process itself, which in turn may impact firm performance. Despite the importance of consumer involvement, research has yet to fully explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and the nature of consumer purchase involvement. This study explores the degree to which consumer perception of salesperson ethical treatment helps explain the relationship between consumer personality characteristics and nature of involvement. Data were collected from a large sample of working adults placed in two scenario-based positive professional sales encounters featuring an important purchase decision. The results indicated that adult consumers’ personality characteristics functioned through judgment of salesperson ethical treatment to affect the nature of purchase involvement. Specifically, consumer judgment of salesperson ethical treatment fully mediated a positive relationship between internal locus of control and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. By comparison, consumer judgment of a salesperson ethical treatment partially mediated the positive relationship between emotional awareness and cognitive (as opposed to affective) involvement. The above findings were similar for informational and relational salesperson customer-orientated scenarios. Key implications for selling professionals and sales organizations are discussed, such as augmenting consumers’ self-assessments to increase their perceptions of salesperson ethics and purchase involvement. The limitations and recommendations for future research are also presented. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Bateman C.R.; Valentine S.R.,Tactical,10.1007/s10551-019-04312-7,Consumer personality; Emotional awareness; Locus of control; Purchase involvement; Salesperson ethicality,5.0,,15,0,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,"The study focuses on the relationship between consumer personality characteristics, salesperson ethics, and consumer involvement in purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing sales encounters and improving consumer engagement.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,"Consumers’ Personality Characteristics, Judgment of Salesperson Ethical Treatment, and Nature of Purchase Involvement",2021

"Aim/Purpose This article takes ‘tourism decision-making behavior’ as an entry point, and deeply analyzes the factors influencing the travel decision-making of Chinese ‘American Travel’ tourists and their degree of influence, so as to provide a reference for the development of Chinese outbound tourism. Background With the development of China’s economy and the improvement in people’s level, the outbound tourism market of Chinese residents has developed rapidly. The United States has become an important tourism destination country for Chinese residents’ outbound tourism, and China has also become one of the important tourist source countries of American tourism. However, the rapid development of ‘American tourism’ has also caused competition problems in China’s tourism industry. For example, prices and tourism products have become a means of competition among tourism enterprises. As the main body of consumption, tourists’ decision-making behavior will be affected by various factors. Methodology Drawing lessons from previous scholars’ research results on tourism decision-making behavior, the influencing factors of tourism decision-making behavior are summarized. A theoretical model and index system of factors influencing tourism decision-making behavior of Chinese residents ‘Travel in the United States’ are established, research hypotheses are put forward, questionnaire data are collected, and SPSS and Amos are used to analyze and verify the theoretical model. Contribution This research expands the literature on topics related to tourism decision-making in research and practice. It establishes a theoretical model and index system for the factors that influence the decision-making behavior of Chinese residents’ ‘American Travel’ tourism. In addition, we propose countermeasures for tourism products, enterprises, and the government. Findings Prior knowledge and external information have a positive influence on tourism perception and value perception, and a negative influence on risk perception. Risk perception value perception has a positive and negative influence on tourism decision-making and tourism motivation, respectively. Tourism motivation has a positive influence on tourism decision-making and has a positive impact. Recommendations According to the research conclusions of this article, the following counter-for Practitioners measures and suggestions are put forward from three aspects of tourism: products, enterprises, and governments. On the basis of existing tourism products, relevant operating companies should pay more attention to the upgrading and transformation of tourism, leisure and entertainment products in scenic spots to increase the willingness of tourists to travel. When considering corporate marketing and promotion plans, tourism companies operating related businesses should increase the weight of their marketing budgets in online marketing, increase investment in online marketing, and develop mobile applications that meet the preferences of Chinese residents in the United States. Do a good job in the timely publication of safety reminders and local information. Safety is an important foundation for tourism development and the core concern of many tourists. Future Research Due to the important research on the impact of tourism activities, the influencing factors are many and complex, and the psychological process of tourism decision-making is carried out directly. There are still unconsidered factors that need to be studied in depth. In the future, it is possible to compare multiple resource-featured themes, and increase the characteristics of potential tourists, and the factors affecting the selection behavior of regional cultural tourists, and so forth, in order to make the research more applicable and practical instructive significance. © 2021.

"Multiple criteria approaches can assist the product manager to know the consumer preferences in the context of e-commerce. Consumer preference analysis explains what aspects of a product affect and how they affect a consumer's purchasing decision. This issue plays an important role in e-commerce platforms from its relevance in marketing decisions such as advertisements, recommendations and promotions. In this regard, we propose a data-driven multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach to integrate online information, such as explicit (e.g., reviews and ratings) and implicit (e.g., clicks and purchases) feedback from consumers. However, MCDA approaches present a critical challenge that even an experienced product manager could find it difficult to pre-define the criteria on which a product is evaluated. To address this issue, our proposed approach first utilizes text-mining techniques to assist the product manager identify the criteria, and then determines and collects the relative importance of the criteria and their values. Given the criteria information, we use a sampling process to provide two indices, the consumer preference index and rank acceptability index. The first index helps in prioritizing the pairwise comparisons of products, while the second one helps in deriving a default ranking list for first-time-registered consumers. We record the products viewed by consumers and generate their preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons for analyses within an aggregation-disaggregation paradigm. We also provide a representative value function to help the product manager gain insight into the preferences. Finally, we describe how a real-world application including the product manager and consumers exploits the proposed approach on an e-commerce platform to take a large step toward aiding more realistic and data-driven multiple criteria decision making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Guo M.; Liao X.; Liu J.; Zhang Q.,Operational,10.1016/j.omega.2019.05.010,E-commerce; Multiple criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preference analysis; Preference modeling,10.0,,60,0,Elsevier Ltd,The abstract describes a data-driven approach to assist product managers in understanding consumer preferences using multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) methods.

"Background: Entanglement of marine species, particularly endangered sea turtles and cetaceans, in abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear is a major conservation concern. Focus of the Article: This case study applies Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to reduce marine wildlife net entanglement in the waters surrounding Masirah Island, a marine biodiversity hotspot in Oman. Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The study demonstrates the use of social marketing tools in biodiversity conservation, bringing new knowledge to the cross-application of these two fields. Methods: The CBSM methodology was applied to select behaviours, identify barriers and benefits, develop strategies and design a pilot study. The responsible disposal of derelict nets in skip bins was selected as the target behaviour, and a mix of behavioural change tools was applied to achieve change: convenience (installation of three skip bins), education (installation of informative signs, distribution of awareness posters, one-to-one engagement with fishers on the beaches), prompts (installation of signs and posters on vessels) and social norms (one-to-one engagement with key influencers and decision makers). The monitoring of behaviour change took place through structured observations over 23 weeks, focussing on the number of nets disposed of in the allocated skip bins. Results: Results showed a low level of behaviour adoption rate by skiff and launch vessel fisheries, respectively, 5.36% and 2.58%. Positive results were observed for a short time but did not reach the estimated target value throughout the study period. Recommendations for Research: Our pilot study did not lead to broad-scale implementation and we recommend further awareness and engagement with the target audience, trials of various behaviour change tools and increase field monitoring time. We further recommend the application and funding of behaviour change methods applied to fishers with the incorporation of conventional financial, conservation and regulatory tools to support resource management. Limitations: Our results show that focussing on specific behaviours with appropriate measurement is both resource and time demanding to solve pressing conservation problems, particularly ones generated by complex industries such as fishing. Various lessons, useful for other social marketers, have been drawn from our evaluation of the overall study. © The Author(s) 2021.",Sarrouf Willson M.; Turley C.; Daar L.A.; Al Masroori H.; Al Muscati H.; Al Aufi M.; Al Bulushi A.; Al Harthi S.; Willson A.,Tactical,10.1177/15245004211053841,behaviour change; community-based social marketing; marine wildlife; net entanglement; Oman,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract describes a specific case study using Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to achieve targeted behavioral changes related to marine wildlife conservation.

"Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is commonly used to manage symptoms in conditions and diseases for which there is limited clinical research for its application. How consumers arrive and decide to use CBD for medical treatment, despite lacking clinical evidence, is largely unknown. In this paper, we seek to identify the informational pathways through which consumers arrive at CBD for medical purposes. Methods: GoFundMe.com campaigns fundraising to purchase CBD between June 2017 and May 2019 were collected using the Crowdfunding for Health Research Portal (CHRP). Product descriptions were thematically analyzed to determine pathways leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment. Campaign characteristics such as fundraising ask, funding received, location, campaign title, description, Facebook shares, and number of donors were recorded. Specific medical uses of CBD proposed in campaigns were tabulated. Results: The study identified 164 crowdfunding campaigns primarily from the USA (n=159), with several from Canada (n=5). The campaigns requested $2,219,284.24 (median, $7000) and raised $610,612.87 (median, $1805) from 6825 donors (median, 26). Many campaigns asked for other treatments or illness-related costs not specific to CBD. The campaigns were shared 42,299 times on Facebook (median, 156 shares). Three informational pathways were identified leading to incorporation of CBD into medical treatment, which were self-directed research (n=149), recommendations from a trusted care provider (n=36), and/or experiential insights shared by someone associated with or influencing the crowdfunders personal network (n=30). The proposed uses of CBD were for cancer (n=96), seizure-inducing diseases/conditions (n=48), other/unspecified (n=6), joint/inflammatory diseases (n=6), mental health disorders (n=3), nervous system diseases (n=3), and autoimmune diseases (n=2). Conclusions: Our results suggest that consumers crowdfunding come to CBD through internally motivated reasons versus exposure to advertisements or other forms of marketing. Campaign beneficiaries generally had an unmet medical need that other forms of treatment were not satisfying. Then, through one or more of the informational pathways identified, CBD is considered a potential solution. © 2021, The Author(s).",Zenone M.A.; Snyder J.; Crooks V.A.,Out of scope,10.1186/s42238-021-00069-x,Cannabidiol; Cannabis; Crowdfunding; Decision-making; Medical treatment,,0.0,0,100,BioMed Central Ltd,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior related to the use of CBD for medical purposes, which falls under healthcare and not marketing.

"Dupe—slang for duplicate—influencers are individuals who persuade buyers to purchase counterfeits using social media platforms to drive a brand message intended to confer legitimacy on the purchase decision. Dupe influencers sell fake luxury goods online to their cadres of followers, who relate to the influencers’ fashion savviness and who trust their judgment of products’ quality. In this article, I provide a synopsis of a case Amazon settled against two dupe influencers who used social media to promote the sale of counterfeit luxury products. I highlight the persistent challenge of luxury counterfeits sold online, the consumer complicity of obtaining luxury fakes, and the problem of discerning a knockoff from a counterfeit product. Dupe influencers leverage trust with their followers and use social media tactics, such as unboxing videos and designer haul promotions, to peddle luxury fakes. Recommendations to combat dupe influencers center on monitoring and working with e-commerce platforms to shut down social media posts that infringe a company's intellectual property, raising consumer awareness of the illicit activities of counterfeiters through education campaigns, leveraging legitimate social influencers to debunk the dupe influencers, and pursuing legal remedies. © 2022 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Chaudhry P.E.,Tactical,10.1016/j.bushor.2022.07.005,Counterfeit goods; Dupe influencer; Influencer marketing; Social media marketing; Trademark infringement,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses specific actions and recommendations to combat dupe influencers and counterfeit luxury goods, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making focused on structured approaches to achieve strategic goals.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Dupe influencers exploiting social media to peddle luxury fakes,2022
"Diversity serves to enrich decision-making, innovation, reputation, and performance. The marketing academy, a microcosm of business and society, is making slow advances in diversity efforts. The study by Galak and Kahn (2021) seeks to codify experiences of gender and race within the marketing academy to elevate awareness and to provide recommendations that may address some of the issues raised. In this commentary, we focus on opportunities to more deeply investigate the complex impact of race on careers and advancement in the marketing academy. Essential further research would advance our understanding of the role of systemic racism—and how it affects the people who are given opportunities to become scholars as well as the research they are encouraged to conduct or can successfully publish in top journals. To more fully understand the climate for traditionally underrepresented faculty members in the USA, it likely necessitates a multi-method approach to generate understanding and insights before developing potential recommendations. To address these types of research questions, we propose a set of studies that would allow an understanding of not only how individuals experience racism, but also how that racism is perpetuated through university admissions, hiring, and promotion decisions. We not only recommend approaches to understand how to increase the presence of historically underrepresented groups in Marketing academia, but also how to enable the full integration and participation of these scholars at all levels in the academic hierarchy, and across all types of institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bradford T.W.; Perry V.G.,Strategic,10.1007/s11002-021-09580-w,Diversity and inclusion; Intersectionality; Marketing academia; Racial discrimination; Racism,5.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to increasing diversity and understanding systemic racism within the marketing academy, aligning with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Marketing while Black: commentary on the Galak and Kahn 2019 Academic Marketing Climate Survey,2021
"Purpose: Marketers are focusing on the need for customer advocacy to influence other customers and drive consumption. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether online or digital advocacy influences customer decision-making related to the purchase of travel and tourism services. This paper will also identify the categories of influencers that stimulate purchase for travel and tourism. Influencers do want to know the kind of information customers are looking for. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a primary survey of travelers to understand their degree of dependence on online reviews while making hospitality consumption-related decisions. Findings: This paper looks at both influencer marketing and online reviews by consumers to understand consumption toward advocated brand. Influencers who are perceived as unbiased in their viewpoints are trending on social media. Consumers gain trust in reviews that disclose reviewer information, number of relevant reviews are present over a period and presence of both unbiased positive and negative recommendations related to the establishment and prices versus performance. Practical implications: Marketers and influencers alike can gain from the factors influencing consumer trust toward online advocacy and reviewed information. Originality/value: Research is relevant for all stakeholders as it highlights the fact that consumers are looking at online reviews and one does not have to be a famous personality to influence purchase. It is relevant for influencers, as it highlights reasons for trust and various information cues that consumers are looking for. Research also gives perspective to influencers to refine online strategy and gain trust of more followers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dutta K.; Sharma K.; Goyal T.,Tactical,10.1108/WHATT-09-2020-0123,Consumer trust; Customer’s digital advocacy; Electronic WOM; Influencer marketing; Online reviews,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract focuses on understanding consumer behavior in relation to online advocacy and reviews, which directly informs marketing strategies and campaigns to influence customer decision-making in the travel and tourism sector.

"Marketers and advertisers ignore new technology and diverse marketing tactics when attempting to increase product exposure, customer engagement, customer behavior and buying intention in fashion accessory marketplaces in developing countries. This research sought to discover how the Augmented Reality (AR) experience influenced consumer behavior, buying intention and pleasure when purchasing a fashion item in developing countries. This study employs positivist ideas to investigate the connections between various factors, believing that reality is unwavering, stable, and static. Experiential marketing following stimulus exposure will gather cross-sectional data. The undertaken study has developed proper experimental design (within group) from business innovation models, for instance, uses and gratification and user experience models. User experience is disclosed by its four defining characteristics: hedonic quality (identification and simulation), aesthetic quality, and pragmatic quality. After encountering an enhanced user experience, users have a more favorable attitude about purchasing; in contrast, pleasure from using the application directly impacts buying intention. It was also shown that knowledge of AR apps impacts user experience and attitude. The novelty of this research is multifarious, for instance, the smart lab was used as a marketing technology to explore a virtual mirror of the Ray-Ban products. Secondly, the augmented reality experiential marketing activities have been developed by the developers as bearing in mind the four different aspects of the user experience—haptic, hedonic, aesthetic, and pragmatic. It should be functional, simple to learn and use, symmetrical, pleasant, and appealing, while fulfilling the unconscious emotional elements of a customer’s purchase. The research is the first known study in Pakistan to evaluate the influence of augmented reality on consumer proficiency and its consequent effects on attitude and satisfaction for fashion accessory brands. The research also advances the notion that application familiarity is the most important moderator between attitude and an augmented reality-enriched user experience, contradicting the prior studies, which focus on gender and age. This research has important theoretical implications for future researchers, who may wish to replicate the proposed final model in developed and developing countries’ fashion brands. This research also has imperative managerial implications for brand managers and marketing managers, who could include the recommendations of this study in their marketing strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

"COVID-19 has impacted not only human lives, but also business organisations. The repercussions of the pandemic on global businesses include sustaining the value of a firm that could benefit stakeholders, such as the challenge for sponsored properties to attain sponsorship through a period of financial struggles and the capacity of a sponsor to provide it. It is imperative for business-to-business (B2B) communities to evaluate criteria and risks of sponsorship to instil public trust and consequently result in value creation for firms. At the same time, the role of the media is pivotal to create visibility of this partnership and achieve set sponsorship aims. With that said, the objective of this study is to explore the role of sponsorship decision making by Malaysian organisations during the pandemic and how the media have strengthened relationship marketing between businesses and their stakeholders; by examining the determinant factors of using media as an activation in sponsorship and the criteria of using media in sponsorship. The qualitative study conducted interviews with 13 corporate communication and marketing managers in Malaysia that are involved directly with sponsorship activation. The findings highlight the sponsorship ecosystem through the Malaysian media and B2B perspectives that would guide practitioners in making strategic decisions on B2B sponsorship matters, particularly on the relational approaches and media engagement should be seen as part of good business conduct.

"Prior research on marketing curriculum design suggests that new course offerings are driven by inputs from faculty resources and interests, student demand and willingness to enroll in the course, and feedback from alumni and employers regarding the skills students need to be successful in the workplace. In the face of the rising costs of higher education and declining enrollments, it is critical that curriculum be developed that strikes a balance between the values and needs of faculty, students, and employers. The current study explores the disconnect between courses students most desire to take and courses business professionals most recommend they take for career success. Utilizing Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) and the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV) as lenses to explore student choice in regard to marketing elective course selection, this study offers empirical data on courses preferred by marketing students and recommended by employers. Findings elucidate similarities and differences between these two stakeholders, which faculty making curriculum decisions will need to navigate.

"This study aims at understanding the channels through which the students have become aware, the channels which they used to search for information on the schools, and the key factor that pushed them to apply for a given school. Through primary data research with n=788 respondents who are currently enrolled in VET across eight schools in Kosovo, the study has identified the critical importance of word-of-mouth through family & relatives, and friends in generating awareness for a given school and sharing information on the school offering. As critical elements to decide to apply for the school have been considered the applicants visit directly to the school to get informed more on the offering and the desire to get equipped with the given qualification the school offers. It is important to note the impact that parents have across all levels from brand awareness development to information search and decision making.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and its potential influence on tourist behaviour in the short- to medium-term. While the influence of the pandemic on tourist’s perceived risk and its impact on their future travel behaviour is understandably yet to be established, the present paper discusses the potential nexus. Additionally, this paper provides tourism practitioners with some recommendations for mitigating the effect of potential heightened perceived risk on travel and tourism decision-making post the COVID-19 crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper synthesises contemporary academic literature on perceived risk and post-crisis tourism with emerging information associated with the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Findings: This paper draws empirical evidence from studies related to previous health crises and their impact on tourism, as well as tourist behaviour. By discussing previous studies within the context of the on-going COVID-19, it is possible to anticipate the influence that perceived risk associated with the pandemic may have on the post-crisis behaviour of tourists. Also, short-term measures to mitigate the effects of risk on tourism are posited to guide practitioners in the future recovery of the sector. Research limitations/implications: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and on-going crisis for the global tourism industry. Hence, the present paper serves as a primer to a broader discussion within the tourism discourse and provides theoretical direction for future tourism research. Practical implications: Key to the recovery of the global tourism industry will be encouraging both domestic and international tourism activity. However, while the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on tourist behaviour is yet to be substantiated, previous research predicts a situation of heightened perceived risk and the potential cognitive dissonance that may negatively influence tourist decision-making. To mitigate this potential effect, governance, augmented immigration policy, destination media profiling, recovery marketing and domestic tourism will be critical interventions. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to discuss the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the post-crisis decision-making process of tourists and their conative behaviour. As a primer to further empirical research, this paper sets a pertinent research agenda for academic inquiry within an evolving and increasingly uncertain global tourism market. © 2020, Tafadzwa Matiza.",Matiza T.,Strategic,10.1108/JTF-04-2020-0063,COVID-19 pandemic; Perceived risk; The future of tourism; Tourism; Tourism recovery; Travel behaviour,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The paper focuses on the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourist behavior and provides recommendations for tourism practitioners, indicating a strategic approach to understanding and responding to changes in the tourism industry.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Post-COVID-19 crisis travel behaviour: towards mitigating the effects of perceived risk,2022
"As a society, we are aiming to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and one of the most important challenges is fostering responsible production and consumption. Green marketing campaigns and instruction in university curricula are an opportunity to influence producers' and consumers' decision-making process in a positive way. This research aims to understand the instructional effects of non-compulsory university courses linked to sustainability and the circular economy (SCE) on students' motivations and behavior. We analyze students' proclivities to consume products and develop more sustainable habits before and after enrolling in SCE courses. Results confirm that the courses impacted students' propensities toward sustainable consumption. Therefore, the biggest changes in the six dimensions underlying green consumption reveal four key recommendations for developing a green marketing strategy. We recommend firms to 1) engage in green education, 2) create community, 3) be aware of consumer diversity, and 4) not differentiate by gender. For this reason, we argue that university education may greatly influence students' mindset concerning sustainable behavior. Results also revealed no significant gender differences, which contrasts with the differentiated behavior found in extant studies on older populations. © 2022 The Authors",Prieto-Sandoval V.; Torres-Guevara L.E.; García-Díaz C.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132509,Circular economy; Green marketing innovation; SDGs; Sustainable development; Young consumer behavior,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term goals related to sustainable development and education's impact on consumer behavior, which aligns with strategic planning in organizations.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Green marketing innovation: Opportunities from an environmental education analysis in young consumers,2022
"Consumers use brands in many combinations, from mixing-and-matching multiple brands (e.g., Nike shoes, Puma shirt, and Asics shorts) to using products primarily or solely from one brand (e.g., Nike shoes, shirt, and shorts). This work explores how such combinations affect observers’ trust in another consumer’s recommendations. Comparing two combination types—mixed-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from different brands) and dominant-brand combinations (where all/most branded products are from the same brand)—nine studies establish that observers tend to have less trust in recommendations from those who use dominant-brand combinations (studies 1A–1C). This is driven by inferences about how the products were chosen: observers believe others who use dominant-brand combinations placed relatively greater importance on the brand—a feature that often serves as a mental shortcut for choices—and therefore infer these consumers made quicker, less thoughtful decisions (studies 2A and 2B). While the effect diminishes when observers hold particularly favorable attitudes toward the focal brand (study 3), it can alter observers’ own downstream behaviors (e.g., social media following intentions, information seeking, and recommendation taking; studies 4A–4C). Together, the findings confirm that brand combinations elicit responses distinct from single brands, offering fruitful avenues for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.

"Mining for truly responsive customers has become an integral part of customer portfolio management, and, combined with operational tactics to reach these customers, requires an integrated approach to meeting customer needs that often involves the application of concepts from traditionally distinct fields: marketing, statistics, and operations research.

"This paper investigates the incentives of e-commerce platforms to show personalized recommendations and its effects on performance. A theoretical framework is developed that characterizes the optimal decision policy of a firm, given current state of shoppers. The key finding is that the firm must always show recommendations to shoppers in the high state above a certain price or value threshold. In the low state, recommending is optimal if the “salience effect” is above a threshold that maximizes discounted future stream of profits. An empirical model provides support to the theoretical findings, highlighting the reputation effects of personalized recommendations, using browsing and purchase data from a Finnish multi-product platform. While recommendations are associated with a 29% increase in firm revenue, relevance of such recommendations potentially boost revenue by a significant 30%. Furthermore, strong evidence is presented that consumer state is endogenous in firm revenue regressions. A three-step IV process extracts the direct effect of consumer state on revenue which shows positive association between reputation effects and firm performance. © 2021 The Author(s)",Basu S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.elerap.2021.101074,e-commerce; personalized recommendations; reputation effects,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the implications of personalized recommendations on e-commerce performance, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on optimizing specific operational strategies to achieve defined targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Personalized product recommendations and firm performance,2021

"Tourists’ satisfaction plays an important role in their decision to return to their previous destinations. The complexity of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty, however, has been increasingly acknowledged in marketing thought and practice. The objective of this study is to explore and test the combined roles of perceived risk and destination knowledge in the satisfaction-loyalty intention relationship. The results indicate the direct effects of perceived risk on visitors’ satisfaction and loyalty intentions. Furthermore, perceived destination knowledge is positively related to visitors’ satisfaction and both the intention to make WOM (word-of-mouth) recommendations and to return. In particular, the effects of visitors’ satisfaction on intention to return and to make WOM recommendations become stronger through the positive moderating effect of perceived destination knowledge. The findings clarify the understanding of how perceived risk and destination knowledge can predict the satisfaction and destination loyalty of tourists. This paper provides a number of managerial implications for communication strategies to improve tourist loyalty. Management implications: This study reinforces established ideas for communication strategies to improve European tourist loyalty: Perceived risk is negatively related to both visitors’ satisfaction and the intention to return. Tourists’ satisfaction is positively related to the intention to recommend by WOM. A positive impact on intentional loyalty, perceived destination knowledge helps to increase tourists’ satisfaction.

"HIGHLIGHTS The family or household provides the major source of labour for undertaking silvicultural practices involved in tree growing. Gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Gender-based allocation of labour is influenced by experience of a household member related to a particular activity as well as competing labour demand in a cropping season. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. Mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. SUMMARY This paper draws on a study conducted in the selected districts of Iringa and Njombe regions in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania where over the past decade Non-industrial Private Forestry (NIPF) has emerged involving village-based domestic investors. Data for the study were largely collected using focus group discussions (FGDs) of men and women tree growers. Data were analysed using content analysis focusing on the emerging themes, subthemes, and patterns. The paper shows that gender division of labour characterizes silvicultural practices in private forestry. Men play a key and dominant role in decision making on the allocation of labour and marketing of timber. We argue that, given this arrangement, as long as men continue to dominate the market sphere, mere ownership of woodlots by women is not a feasible pathway to having control over income obtained from the sales of timber from their woodlots. To address this, the paper comes up with some recommendations. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

"Purpose. The objective of the study is to substantiate the feasibility of marketing management implementation in agricultural enterprises to ensure their competitiveness. Methodology / approach. To achieve the research objective, the dialectical method of scientific inquiry, as well as general scientific methods, such as analysis, synthesis, comparison, economic-and-mathematical modeling (balance-optimization model), visualization and generalization were used to collect, analyze, evaluate, inform and present the study results and conclusions. Results. It was substantiated that marketing management, as a prominent component of crisis management, should be introduced in agricultural enterprises to identify most promising areas of their activity within current business environment in order to ensure their competitiveness. The efficiency and prospects of organic produce farming in Ukraine have been proved, as a contribution to the improvement of the economic, social and ecological conditions in the country. It was suggested that agricultural enterprises should apply a strategy of full or partial diversification of activities based on organic farming. The study presented the use of a balance-optimization model to make informed management decisions as to optimization of the crop sector production structure of an agricultural enterprise, focused on market demand and compliant with principles of sustainable development.

"Sustainability in architecture engages a wide range of considerations in the light of the significant negative impact of buildings on the environment. One aspect of research in this parlance engages the technological and the social dimensions of building innovation, which promote the use of renewable technology as a mitigation strategy. The challenge, however, is that the end-users or building clients do not always have sufficient awareness and information regarding these technologies to guide their decision to accept it. Consequently, the diffusion of said innovations is slow, and the environmental or building problems they were invented to solve persist at the expense of both humanity and the environment. This study, therefore, focuses on a quantitative investigation to ascertain the level of awareness and interest of residents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as an example of renewable energy-based building technology. In this study, 289 residents participated, following the distribution of a questionnaire to demographically distinct individuals. This distinction was used in the analysis to highlight different groups such as, gender, generations, and occupational background of the respondents. The findings of the study show, firstly, that there is a high level of awareness of BIPV in the sample. The study also shows that comparing awareness with each of these demographic variables produced a second layer of findings. For example, the statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference between the level of awareness and any of the demographic characteristics of the study participants. However, there is a significant statistical difference (p = 0.000) between awareness and interest in BIPV. In concluding this study, recommendations for further research that elaborates other statistical variables and tests, as well as a follow-up qualitative investigation are planned and outlined for future studies.

"Purpose Beaches are icons of summer tourism and a strong motivating factor for the arrival of tourists in the sun and sea tourism destinations. Spending time on the beach is one of the most popular forms of tourism leisure worldwide. Beaches serve both as recreational areas of coastal cities, and valuable ecosystems that provide natural and protective functions. The Croatian coast is relatively rich in this valuable tourism resource, but the management of beaches as a tourist product has not reached significant progress. This dissertation aims to contribute to the sustainable management of beaches as a tourism product and recognises the possibility of involving all stakeholders in this process by studying socio-demographic factors, preferences, satisfaction, and future behavioural intentions of beach visitors. This knowledge can make an important contribution to the beach management process because it can be used to make more informed management decisions. Which characteristics of a particular beach need to be improved, what facilities should be introduced or discontinued, beach managers can find out through social science research methods that can encourage participation of all stakeholders, increase visitor satisfaction and destination competitiveness, and thus lay the groundwork for more sustainable development of beaches as tourism products. The purpose of this doctoral dissertation is to develop a cognitive-affective-conative model of beach visitor satisfaction. This dissertation developed, validated, and tested an empirical model of beach visitor satisfaction by combining the sustainable development framework, international coastal zone management protocols, and national legislation with theories of satisfaction, quality, and consumer behaviour. The empirical model includes measures of beach visitor satisfaction levels with natural beach features, beach facilities, overall beach experience, emotional experience and their future behavioural intention. Methodology The study follows a mixed method design, employing both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used for the purpose of testing the links between model constructs. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used in analyses of socio-demographic variable influences of beach visitors. Data was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire on three separate beach locations in the Primorsko – goranska county littoral during the summer of 2021, with the paper assisted personal interview (PAPI) technique. A 5-point Likert scale was used in attribute level satisfaction and importance performance measurements. Qualitative methods include investigation by an unstructured inquiry of importance, concerning beach attributes not mentioned in the structured part of the questionnaire, as an opening of an unstructured interview with the beach visitor. Findings of the qualitative analysis have shown that beach visitors also value cultural factors and place high importance on beach sediment quality. Findings The findings of the descriptive statistical analyses concerning socio-demographic characteristics of beach visitors indicate that on average, women (59.4%) visit the beach more than men (40.6%). The most frequent age group of beach visitors is in between 45-54 years old (25.7%), followed by visitors in between 15-24 (21%) years old. Regarding education levels, on average most visitors have finished high school (54.6%) followed by visitors with university level education (43.5%). Foreign tourists make up most of beach visitors (60.2%) while domestic tourists are second most represented (20.7%), followed by local residents (17.2%) and season residents (1.9%). Concerning the habits of beach visitors, they are most likely to visit the beach as a family with children (31.3%), as a couple (26.8%) or with friends (26.3%). Beach visitors will most likely use a car to get to the beach (77.7%), go on foot (12.5%) or use public transport (8.8%). Concerning the time they spend on the beach, most visitors stay in between 3-5 hours long (39.5%), followed by stays in between 1-3 hours long (38.2%) and stays over 5 hours long (21.2%). The descriptive statistical analyses of structural model independent variable constructs for the whole sample of all three beaches, indicates that regarding beach natural characteristics, beach visitors are most satisfied with beach scenery = 4.57, cleanliness of the sea = 4.47 and texture of beach sediment = 4.06. Beach visitors are somewhat satisfied with the opportunities to observe maritime species = 3.42. The least levels of beach visitor satisfaction are with available shade on the beaches = 2.82. Concerning beach visitor satisfaction with beach facilities, all average values of individual attributes are below 4, which indicates that beach visitors are on average more satisfied with the natural beach attributes than facilities available at the beaches. In the overall sample, beach visitors are satisfied the least with lifeguard and/or medical service = 2.90, accessibility to the beach and sea for persons with disabilities = 2.97, rental service of water sport and recreation equipment = 3.12, parking space availability = 3.12, shower availability = 3.13, toilet cleanliness = 3.15 and toilet availability = 3.24. Beach visitors are satisfied the most with bar and restaurant service on the beaches = 3.99, clearly designated safe swimming areas in the sea = 3.88, litter bin availability = 3.88 and with areas for sport, recreation, and children play on the beaches = 3.81. Concerning the descriptive analyses of beach visitor emotional experiences, measured on the Destination Emotion Scale (DES), on average beach visitors feel joy = 4.21 the most, followed by the emotion of love = 3.84 and positive surprise = 3.69. Beach visitor satisfaction with the overall experience at the beaches is on average relatively high = 4.29, as are the intention of revisit = 4.49, and the intention of recommending the beach = 4.35 The results of the bivariate statistical analysis show significant statistical differences in overall experience satisfaction regarding visitor type, while no differences were found by age or gender. Domestic tourists are least satisfied on average, while season residents are satisfied the most. The results partially support hypothesis H1. Significant statistical differences were found in the construct of intention of recommendation by gender and age. Women have a higher intention to recommend the beach than men. Age groups of 15-24 years of age tend to recommend the beach the least, while age groups of 45-54 and 55-64 have the highest levels of recommendation intention. These results partially support hypothesis H2, as no differences were found by beach visitor type. Women also have a higher intention of revisit the beach then men, while local residents and season residents have significantly higher intention of revisit than tourists, partially supporting hypothesis H3, as no differences by age were found. Lastly, the results of multivariate statistical analysis show that satisfaction with natural beach characteristics affects satisfaction with the overall experience at the beach (β=0.529, p<.01), intention to revisit (β=0.37, p<.01) and intention to recommend (β=0.497, p<.01). Thus, confirming hypothesis H4, H5 and H6. Satisfaction with beach facilities affects the overall experience satisfaction with the beach (β=0.189, p<.01), the intention to revisit (β=0.146, p<.01) and the intention to recommend the beach (β=0.106, p<.01) confirming hypotheses H7, H8 and H9. Concerning the impact of beach visitor emotions on the overall beach experience, the results show that joy (β=0.437, p<.01), love (β=0.203, p<.01) and positive surprise (β=0.105, p<.05) have a significant impact. Confirming in this way hypothesis H10. The impact of emotions on revisit intention is also statistically significant for joy (β=0.442, p<.01) and love (β=0.266, p<.01), while positive surprise is not related to revisit intention (β=0.061, p=0.271). By this, hypothesis H11 is partially confirmed. Concerning the effect of emotions on recommendation intention, both joy (β=0.445, p<.01) and love (β=0.27, p<.01) affect recommendation intention, while the relationship with positive surprise is not statistically significant (β=0.047, p=0.333). The results confirm partially hypothesis H12. Satisfaction with overall beach experience is significantly related to the intention of revisit (β=0.585, p<.01) and with the intention of recommendation (β=0.597, p<.01) confirming hypothesis H13 and H14 respectively. Mediation analysis results indicate that emotions partially mediate the relationship between satisfaction with natural beach characteristics and overall experience at the beach, while complete mediation of emotions is established between satisfaction with beach facilities and overall experience satisfaction. Finally, confirming hypothesis H15 and H16 respectively. Originality of the research In an innovative approach, while responding to the calls of several authors from the literature of tourism and marketing for the creation of integrative models of satisfaction with both cognitive and affective components, the Destination Emotion Scale (DES) is used in the context of modelling overall beach visitors’ satisfaction affective component. Furthermore, by assessing the importance of beach facilities at the natural beach, opposed to satisfaction with beach facilities on beaches in urban areas at the same time, an innovative integral assessment of wider coastal area beaches is enabled no matter the beach type. This is achieved by the combination of satisfaction and importance measurements of beach facilities in the overall beach sample. In this manner, the importance of facilities at the natural beach, becomes a control variable, and the results of independent variable attribute level statistical significance measurements may be interpreted as significant, controlling for the fact that beach visitors may have different priorities regarding facilities on the natural beach in a rural setting, than visitors of beaches in urban settings. This dissertation establishes the applicative, theoretical, and empirical validity of the observation of beaches as tourism products. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how this approach incorporates the principles of sustainable development while simultaneously being oriented towards some of the most important theoretical determinants of successful business operations – visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions. By assessing the reliability and validity of the empirical model and testing the proposed scientific hypotheses, new insights into the area of beach visitor satisfaction have been explored and revealed, these insights establish emotions as a reliable predictor of beach visitor satisfaction and future behavioural intentions and include different emotional experiences of visitors on a natural beach in a rural environment. © 2022, University of Rijeka.

"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post-crisis, policy-makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re-establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Lee C.-C.; Olasehinde-Williams G.; Akadiri S.S.,Strategic,10.1002/jtr.2389,covid-19; geopolitical risk; second-generation panel; tourism,5.0,,10,5,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,"The abstract discusses the long-term impacts of geopolitical risks on tourism demand and suggests policy recommendations for crisis management and recovery marketing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,70,10,Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models,2021
"This paper aims at investigating the effect of internal green marketing mix elements on Mu’tah University students’ satisfaction in Jordan. This study is based on quantitative approach methodology to collect the primary data. The researchers developed a questionnaire to measure the study constructs, which included 27 items. Five hundred questionnaire forms were distributed to the study sample. Four hundred and seventy-five (475) questionnaire forms were valid for analysis. Some analysis tests, such as data screening, data descriptive testing, reliability and hypothesis testing, were conducted using SPSS, v. 20 and AMOS, v. 16. The results of this study indicated that there are seven supported hypotheses related to green product, green price, green place, green promotion, green provided information, green process and green people, respectively. But, one hypothesis related to green policy was not supported. Finally, some recommendations presented in this study targeted academics and decision makers in Jordan in this filed. © 2020 DAR Publishers/The University of Jordan.

"Problem definition: Sequential experiments that are deployed in a broad range of practices are characterized by an exploration-exploitation trade-off that is well understood when in each time period feedback is received only on the action that was selected in that period. However, in many practical settings, additional information may become available between decision epochs. We study the performance that one may achieve when leveraging such auxiliary information and the design of algorithms that effectively do so without prior knowledge of the information arrival process. Methodology/results: Our formulation considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about rewards from actions and allows auxiliary observations from these distributions to arrive according to an arbitrary and a priori unknown process. When it is known how to map auxiliary observations to reward estimates, we characterize the best achievable performance as a function of the information arrival process. In terms of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling algorithms possess natural robustness with respect to the information arrival process, which uncovers a novel property of these popular algorithms. When the mappings connecting auxiliary observations and rewards are a priori unknown, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which auxiliary information allows performance improvement and devise an adaptive policy (termed 2UCBs) that guarantees near optimality. We use a data set from a large media site to analyze the value that may be captured by leveraging auxiliary observations in the design of content recommendations. Managerial implications: Our study highlights the importance of utilizing auxiliary information in the design of sequential experiments and characterizes how salient features of the auxiliary information stream impact performance. Our study also emphasizes the risk in processing auxiliary information using nonadaptive approaches that are predicated on correct interpretation of this information, as opposed to deploying flexible, adaptive methods. © 2022 INFORMS.",Gur Y.; Momeni A.,Tactical,10.1287/msom.2022.1116,experiments; OM-marketing interface; pricing and revenue management; service operations; stochastic methods,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses the design of algorithms and methodologies for leveraging auxiliary information in sequential experiments, which implies structured decision-making processes to improve performance.

"The research aims to assess the extent of overtourism in Budapest. The analysis first introduces a system of criteria for a sustainable destination, highlighting the capacity network, institutional system, structural aspects, and architectural infrastructure load of a sustainable region. A survey of the relevant literature reveals the increasing scholarly attention paid to the phenomenon of overtourism, while singling out Budapest as one of the most affected urban areas. One potential explanation for Budapest's situation is that it developed as a result of a decreasing ability of the central districts to absorb a growing visitor load, along with a decline in the seasonal distribution of tourism. The current situation could also have emerged because the respective negative consequences were not counteracted by the inclusion of local residents. The residential segments and inhabitants were not allocated a share in the tourism-related income and, despite the steady growth in visitor numbers, they were not consulted either. The in-depth interviews with the residents of Erzsébetvâros confirm that the intensity of the irritation level indicated on the Irridex scale developed by Doxy (1975) can be divided into various stages with time. As part of the research, the authors surveyed 510 international visitors concerning tourism activities. Furthermore, the study proposes solutions to the problems related to overtourism and presents a survey of relevant recommendations by international organizations. To address overtourism, the capital requires quick decisions. Demand needs to be diversified; new sustainable tourism products need to be introduced. Visitors to Budapest should be extended in space and time, while the interest of domestic tourists in the city should be raised through strong marketing activities. Stricter regulations should be adopted for local entrepreneurs; more support should be given to contactless solutions (Jamal-Budke 2020). In the post-COVID-19 period, the overtourism is reduced and the search for close-to-nature experiences is replaced by creative tourism (Nagy et al. 2018). © 2021.

"Brand resonance is a marketing concept under-explored in the performing arts context. This paper responds by analysing focus group findings from a large Opera group, “Big Opera[1]” (For research integrity and anonymity requirements of focus group research, the company pseudonym is Big Opera) on how decision-makers can enhance brand resonance. Opera patronage was dwindling before the COVID-19 pandemic, which was further crystallized during the pandemic. As the performing arts sector tries to revive, it is useful to understand how brand resonance concepts can be used to reinvigorate patronage at the opera. A qualitative study of four opera focus groups, which included 24 participants with varying levels of attendance was conducted to examine brand resonance. The study reveals that when customers have brand attachment and love, developed through intense experiences at the opera, facilitated by engagement with the brand, and community, then brand loyalty develops for the opera by intention to re-purchase. The paper contributes to the literature by making recommendations on how to enhance brand resonance thereby increasing attendance. Intense experiences at the opera and engagement can be enhanced by offering packaged deals, such as accommodation and dinner, or drinks and canapés packages, backstage access, the development of a social club, social media brand community and loyalty programs to increase brand loyalty. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Hall E.; Menzies J.; Zutshi A.; Creed A.,Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12743,attendance; brand resonance; focus group; opera; performing arts,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses specific strategies and recommendations to increase brand resonance and attendance at the opera, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Opera participants’ perceptions of brand resonance,2022

"Market diversification, one critical means by which tourism-dependent small island states can maintain sector resilience and destination life cycle stability, requires understanding of the destination loyalty of strategic new inbound markets such as China. An online survey of 1260 Chinese adults with previous travel experience to the Maldives identified positive proclivities with respect to revisitation and recommendation intentions as well as agreement that Chinese visitors were well catered for. Sample diversity, however, was demonstrated by cluster analysis, which revealed dominant ‘highly loyal’ (31.2%) and ‘loyal’ (37.1%) segments along with specialized clusters ambivalent about the catering (14.3%) or the revisitation intent (17.4%). Loyalty was strongly associated with older, married and higher income visitors who were aware that the Maldives is an Islamic country and who included the capital city of Male in their itinerary. Such information is invaluable for assisting target marketing and product development strategies, but situates in a context of bilateral asymmetry in which the Chinese government can destabilize small island tourism through decisions that curtail visitation by otherwise loyal residents. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Weaver D.; Tang C.; Lawton L.; Liu Y.,Tactical,10.1080/14616688.2019.1623300,China; destination life cycle; destination loyalty; Small island resilience; the Maldives; 中国,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the loyalty segments of Chinese tourists to the Maldives and suggests implications for target marketing and product development strategies.

"In recent years, the world has gone through, and continues to go through, periods that no one anticipated, and on the contrary, society excluded as even possible. In 2019, COVID-19 and its global pandemic appeared. In 2022, the war in Ukraine began. The whole world and society in particular, is thus facing a completely new reality and the changes that this reality brings. More than ever, human values and psychological aspects are coming into the centre of interest and attention. Within companies and business, especially marketing and marketing communication must react and adapt to these changes and trends. Their importance is growing primarily as tools for achieving company goals. The branding phenomenon is closely linked to marketing and communication. The brand, its image, persona, values, opinions, attitudes, but also its emotional state and archetype, these are the key factors for its current success and its power. The aim of our study is to describe the current state and trends in the field of marketing and marketing communication in close connection with the brand, which is essential for the success of the company. In the next part our study focuses on the brand primarily from a psychological point of view. The theoretical part is followed by the research part, in which we analyse in detail the studies by Kantar agency, which were focused, on the one hand, on the consumers, changes in their behaviour and decision-making, and on the other hand on the brand, its position and communication in times of crisis. Our objective was to identify key factors and recommendations for these areas that are appropriate and beneficial to apply in business practice. © 2022, Communication Today.

"This research examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media marketing in India. There is little research on the impact of a pandemic on consumer behaviors. To address this gap, this exploratory study surveyed Indian consumers’ social media behaviors. Observations from 313 Indian consumers were collected to compare how their social media behaviors for consumer decision-making have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic started. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test mean differences in social media behaviors prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The findings demonstrated increased usage of social media as a tool for consumer decision-making. With the global reach of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implications of a growing prominence of social media in consumer-decision making are likely relevant to most nations. Recommendations for the use of social media as a marketing tool are provided. © 2021 The Author(s).

"A significant area of Social Computing is the Social Network Service (SNS), known as Social Network Applications. In recent years, researchers have commonly used SNS as an instrument for linking and communicating. Homestay travel has been prevalent for a long time with the rise of social media. The goal of this study is to examine the influence of Social Network Service functions on homestay travel intention in Vietnam. Fourteen Social Network Service functions were summarized from the literature review and used as the variables influencing the purpose of homestay travel to develop a five-point Likert scale questionnaire for convenience sampling to perform an online survey. For further study, two hundred and twenty valid respondents were included. The GM(1, N) analysis showed interest sharing, photo sharing, and video sharing as the first to third most principal factors in their highly seasoned weighting towards homestay travel intention. On the other side, helping decision, helping interaction, and helping planning as the last three lists of weighting scores. Besides, multiple regression analysis shows that offering recommendations, helping planning, and sharing interest simultaneously predict homestay travel intention while the others don’t. That means consumers would heavily rely upon the functions of sharing interest of social network services to evaluate their traveling options. It is proposed that homestay traveling vendors should pay more attention to the marketing of previous travelers’ experiential interests to provoke the awareness of customers. © 2022 Institute of Information Science.

"Sustainability marketing has emerged as an important trend both in practice and academic literature. The relevant literature has heavily focused on determinations of sustainable consumer behavior, and practitioners have used these results to derive short-term marketing decisions, e.g., adequate pricing of sustainable products. However, no study has scrutinized derivations of sustainable brand personalities or provided important long-term, strategic, managerial implications for marketing managers of sustainable brands. This study aims to contribute to this underrepre-sented research field and makes recommendations for preferred brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands. First, the personality structure of sustainable consumers by using a preference-based two-step segmentation approach is investigated, and subsequent profiling of the sustainable consumer segment is conducted. The research relies on the results of an empirical discrete choice experiment and a personality test, including the data of a representative German consumer sample. Sustainable consumers were found to be highly agreeable and open. Second, the personality results of sustainable consumers are linked to consumers’ personality-specific preferred brand personalities. Third, recommendations for harmonic brand personality dimensions for sustainable brands, e.g., competence, excitement, and sincerity, are derived, and therefore, long-term, strategic, managerial implications are provided. © 2021 by the author.

"As a result of creative accounting, many firms in the Iraqi stock market are able to achieve two very significant goals: first, to boost the market value of their shares and thus gain the biggest trading volume in shares, and second, to lower their earnings in order to decrease the tax burden. First by growing its profits, then by evading taxes and denying the state its right to its money. Using this research, we hope to demonstrate how financial institutions that use innovative accounting tools in the preparation of their financial statements impact trade activity. Trading volume is critical to accurately forecasting stock price patterns, allowing investors to maximize their wealth. So, without accounting information, the financial markets can't play their function in drawing in investment, ensuring a well-balanced use of resources, and making reasonable economic decisions, because they don't have the accounting knowledge to do so. There were four sections to the research, which included a look at the research methodology and previous studies, a look at creative accounting practices, and an analysis of the financial statements for the top and bottom ten companies in terms of trading volume using Miller's model to detect profit manipulation that occurred in those companies.

"The role of virtual salesperson (VS) and the importance of customer reviews in facilitating online purchase decisions and sales have recently received much attention from technology companies, marketing practice professionals, and academics. However, customers’ willingness to follow the purchase advice of the VS when there is a conflict between these recommendations and those of other online customers is less understood. This research theorizes and investigates the extent to which customers’ relationship satisfaction with, and trust in, the VS helps explain customer willingness to follow VS advice in the context of recommendation conflict. Using four studies, our research explores how and when the VS’s avatar design mitigates the negative influence of conflict. An important theoretical and managerial implication of this research is that VS avatar designs that are high in automated social presence (ASP) help reduce the negative impact of conflict. However, we find that ASP mitigates the negative effects of conflict only for avatars that score low (vs. high) on cuteness. © The Author(s) 2020.",Lin Y.-T.; Doong H.-S.; Eisingerich A.B.,Operational,10.1177/1094670520964872,avatar design; cuteness; relationship satisfaction; social presence; trust,5.0,,70,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the role of virtual salespersons and how their design influences customer decision-making related to online purchases.
