"Marketing and consumer research use a variety of data and electronic measurement devices for research, theory-building, and applied decision-making. Managing data deluge produced by ‘smart devices’ and internet of things (IoT) actuators and sensors is one of the challenges faced by managers when using IoT systems. With the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence, which are advancing a ‘smart world’ and introducing automation in many application areas, such as ‘smart marketing,’ a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like, ChatGPT and Bart, and technologies like nanotechnology. The article introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC)—an emerging concept that decentralizes operations, management, and data into the network utilizing a distributed and federated computing paradigm. Although numerous research studies have been published on ‘smart’ applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous marketing applications requiring real-time processing of ‘big data’ typical of smart marketing ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.",Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.,Strategic,10.1007/s11301-024-00441-0,Artificial intelligence (AI); Digital marketing; Edge computing; Fog computing; Marketing internet of things (MIoT); O; Smart marketing; Software defined networks (SDN),5.0,,10,5,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses the implications of IoT-driven fog computing for smart marketing, indicating a long-term vision for how technology can enhance marketing strategies.

"Companies neither fully exploit the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), nor that of Machine Learning (ML), its most prominent method. This is true in particular of marketing, where its possible use extends beyond mere segmentation, personalization, and decision-making. We explore the drivers of and barriers to AI and ML in marketing by adopting a dual strategic and behavioral focus, which provides both an inward (AI and ML for marketers) and an outward (AI and ML for customers) perspective. From our mixed-method approach (a Delphi study, a survey, and two focus groups), we derive several research propositions that address the challenges facing marketing managers and organizations in three distinct domains: (1) Culture, Strategy, and Implementation; (2) Decision-Making and Ethics; (3) Customer Management. Our findings contribute to better understanding the human factor behind AI and ML, and aim to stimulate interdisciplinary inquiry across marketing, organizational behavior, psychology, and ethics. © 2022 The Authors",Volkmar G.; Fischer P.M.; Reinecke S.,Strategic,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.04.007,Artificial Intelligence; Decision- Making; Delphi Method; Ethics; Machine Learning; Marketing Management,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of AI and ML in marketing, focusing on long-term challenges and opportunities such as culture, strategy, and ethics, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,25,"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Exploring drivers, barriers, and future developments in marketing management",2022
"An efficient store layout presents merchandise to attract customer attention and encourages customers to walk down more aisles which exposes them to more merchandise, which has been shown to be positively correlated with the sales. It is one of the most effective in-store marketing tactics which can directly influence customer decisions to boost store sales and profitability. The recent development of Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially with its sub-fields in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, has enabled retail stores to take advantage of existing CCTV infrastructure to extract in-store customer and business insights. This research aims to conduct a comprehensive review on existing approaches in store layout design and modern AI techniques that can be utilized in the layout design task. Based on this review, we propose an AI-powered store layout design framework. This framework applies advanced AI and data analysis techniques on top of existing CCTV video surveillance infrastructure to understand, predict and suggest a better store layout. © 2022, The Author(s).",Nguyen K.; Le M.; Martin B.; Cil I.; Fookes C.,Tactical,10.1007/s10462-022-10142-3,Business intelligence; CCTV visual intelligence; Retail layout; Store layout; Video analytic,5.0,,15,0,Springer Nature,"The abstract discusses AI techniques applied to store layout design, which involves structured decisions aimed at improving marketing strategies and customer engagement.

"Despite offering substantial opportunities to tailor services to consumers’ wants and needs, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies often come with ethical and operational challenges. One salient instance of such challenges emerges when vulnerable consumers, consumers who temporarily or permanently lack resource access or control, are unknowingly discriminated against, or excluded from the marketplace. By integrating the literature on consumer vulnerability, AI for social good, and the calls for rethinking marketing for a better world, the current work builds a framework on how to leverage AI technologies to detect, better serve, and empower vulnerable consumers. Specifically, our AID framework advocates for designing AI technologies that make services more accessible, optimize customer experiences and journeys interactively, and to dynamically improve consumer decision-making. Adopting a multi-stakeholder perspective, we also discuss the respective implications for researchers, managers, consumers, and public policy makers. © 2023, The Author(s).",Hermann E.; Williams G.Y.; Puntoni S.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-023-00986-8,Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Justice; Service; Vulnerable consumers,5.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of leveraging AI technologies to serve vulnerable consumers and outlines a framework for integrating AI into marketing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,20,Deploying artificial intelligence in services to AID vulnerable consumers,2023
"Introduction – Current study examines the relationship between Digital Advertising (DA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their impact on creating a suitable Marketing Strategy (MS) for any organization. The study suggests some measures that can help marketers to improve their marketing strategies. As a genuine branch of Marketing science, digital marketing managed to create value for organizations and increased engagement with customers through electronic services. The Digital era has helped industries monitor their procedures including branding, promotion, advertising, production, channel distribution, etc. Based on gathered data, interactive customer experience, and a digital overview of procedures and sales, business managers could make more accurate and data-driven decisions. Methodology: This paper searches the various dimensions attached to the concept of artificial intelligence and digital advertising. It is a descriptive study; the survey method was used for the collection of data. Artificial Intelligence Survey Instrument (Weng, 2020), and Marketing Strategy Scale (Weng, 2020), whose face, discriminant, and construct validity were measured. Apart from this, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) and composite reliability (CR) were calculated to measure their reliability. Analysis of required data was done by using the SPSS software package (ver. 22) in the form of descriptive statistics as well as the SmartPLS software by means of inferential statistics and structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The way we communicate with consumers has changed marketing. It is morphing every day and that’s where the big shift has happened. The big change that is happening in marketing, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. It creates new opportunities for storytelling and marketing. It will change how people interact with information, technology, brands, and services. Thus, marketers must adopt artificial intelligence systems in their marketing strategies to succeed in the present era of digital marketing. It saves both time and money for the marketers, customers, and prospects; and occupies the minds of customers without human intervention. The study results can be assistance to business managers and strategy practitioners to figure out the interrelationships between DA and AI, and their impact on marketing strategy formation. © 2022,Journal of Content, Community and Communication.

"Corporate identity plays an important role in the success and competitiveness of businesses in today’s dynamic business environment. It encompasses brand identity, organisational culture, values, and reputation, and is key in building relationships with stakeholders. An ethical corporate identity, in particular the perception of a company as ethical and socially responsible, positively influences employee behaviour and engagement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionised business management and offers innovative solutions to improve decision-making, efficiency, and transparency. Integrating AI into corporate governance can improve risk management, compliance, and accountability. In the digital age, social media are key in building and maintaining the brand voice of businesses. With the advent of AI, new tools such as Chat GPT have emerged to simplify and accelerate content creation, including social media posts. However, achieving satisfactory brand-voice results using AI requires careful analysis and extensive, representative data that travels into the prompter. Although AI-generated content is fast, it should be vetted by experienced experts to ensure it aligns with brand values and brand image. Although Chat GPT promises to generate content and brand-voice, its successful use requires collaboration with experienced experts and thoughtful consideration of its use in building and maintaining an authentic and effective brand-voice. © (2024), (University of SS.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic situations and identify the research that is needed in the area of applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Stone M.; Aravopoulou E.; Ekinci Y.; Evans G.; Hobbs M.; Labib A.; Laughlin P.; Machtynger J.; Machtynger L.,Strategic,10.1108/BL-03-2020-0022,Artificial intelligence; Decision-making; Marketing; Operations; Planning; Strategy,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the application of AI in strategic marketing decision-making, emphasizing the long-term implications and the need for research in this area as the focus shifts from operational to strategic applications of AI.",scopus-ai,70,15,Artificial intelligence (AI) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda,2020
"Some businesses on product development prefer to use a chatbot for judging the customer's view. Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Zheng S.; Yahya Z.; Wang L.; Zhang R.; Hoshyar A.N.,Operational,10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103446,Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing,5.0,,65,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model to improve the performance of chatbots, which are primarily focused on managing day-to-day consumer interactions and decision-making processes.

"The latest effort in delivering computing resources as a service to managers and consumers represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to users over the internet from large-scale data centers. However, with the advent of the cloud-based IoT and artificial intelligence (AI), which are advancing customer experience automations in many application areas, such as recommender systems (RS), a need has arisen for various modifications to support the IoT devices that are at the center of the automation world, including recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard and technologies like nanotechnology. This paper introduces the marketing community to a recent computing development: IoT-driven fog computing (FC). Although numerous research studies have been published on FC “smart” applications, none hitherto have been conducted on fog-based smart marketing domains such as recommender systems. FC is considered a novel computational system, which can mitigate latency and improve bandwidth utilization for autonomous consumer behavior applications requiring real-time data-driven decision making. This paper provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research by using, as an example, the intersection of FC and RS. Indeed, our conceptualization of the “fog-based recommender systems” opens many novel and challenging avenues for academic research, some of which are highlighted in the later part of this paper. © 2024 by the authors.",Hornik J.; Ofir C.; Rachamim M.; Graguer S.,Strategic,10.3390/jtaer19010032,artificial intelligence (AI); edge computing; fog computing; internet of things (IoT); recommender system; software defined networks (SDNs),5.0,,10,5,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses a conceptual framework for studying the effects of fog computing on consumer behavior, which indicates a focus on long-term implications and the exploration of novel research avenues.

"Artificial intelligence is a technology that simulates human intelligence by simulating human learning, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities through computer systems. In recent years, the rapid development and widespread application of AI have had a profound impact on enterprise management. Enterprise management is no longer limited to traditional manual decision-making and processes, but has been endowed with more efficient and intelligent methods through AI technology. The value co creation theory has completely changed the management methods of modern enterprises, transforming them from simple value carriers to active value co creators. In this situation, enterprise value chain management requires strategic enhancement, optimized design, functional management, and reputation management to adapt to these changes. The emergence of artificial intelligence as the core of the new industrial revolution further amplifies the importance of these adaptations. Under the guidance of value co creation theory, this article analyzes and explores the structure, characteristics, and transformation of enterprise value chains. Explored the management strategies of enterprise value chains, with a particular focus on the composition of consumer centered value chains. In addition, it also studied the use of artificial intelligence to deepen the enterprise management value chain, strengthen its architecture through artificial intelligence technology, and design an effective enterprise management system. Considering the changes in the business model of the entire value chain system, the transformation mechanism of artificial intelligence in the enterprise value chain was studied. Integrating neural network algorithms into enterprise management systems can achieve optimization and form a new enterprise management value chain. Empirical experiments and surveys have proven the effectiveness of the new value chain, significantly improving customer satisfaction (11.45%), customer experience satisfaction (13.61%), enterprise marketing satisfaction (11.73%), and enterprise service satisfaction (10.63%). © 2023, Success Culture Press.

"Learning outcomes: After studying and analyzing this case, students will be able to: understand and evaluate the integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategy for online businesses; understand and create the various components of an IMC plan; determine the challenges of scaling up a business and how social media marketing can help in that; learn how to assemble the positioning statement of a startup; determine and differentiate the different business models (revenue models); and understand and create the social media marketing strategy. Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

"TikTok is increasingly influential in promoting brand awareness and boosting purchase intention. From a social media marketing perspective, brand awareness significantly influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and measure the factors influencing the brand awareness of TikTok users through social media marketing communications. The paper employs exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s Alpha test, and regression analysis to test the hypotheses. 24 observed variables were divided into six groups. Each variable was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. The sample size includes 240 valid responses from TikTok users collected via convenience sampling. The questionnaire was distributed to TikTok users from Vietnam via the link on Google Forms. The collected data were processed by SPSS 20 software. The results suggest that six independent variables positively affect brand recognition via social media marketing on TikTok, with a 95% confidence interval at Sig. = 0.000 (0.05). Each of the six variables positively impacts initial expectations and is statistically significant at 1%. The results show that trends (Beta = 0.299) are the most decisive factors impacting brand awareness of TikTok users. Besides, electronic word of mouth (Beta = 0.242), influencer (Beta = 0.220), entertainment (Beta = 0.206), interaction (Beta = 0.200), and storytelling (Beta = 0.179) also positively affect the brand awareness of TikTok users.

"Herbicides are used worldwide to protect agricultural crops, glyphosate being among the most frequently applied. In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.",Venâncio C.; Barbosa C.; Lopes I.,Out of scope,10.3390/su151612428,environmentally relevant; green hydra; herbicide; life cycle parameters; plant protection products,0.0,,0,100,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"The abstract discusses the ecological and toxicological effects of glyphosate and its commercial formulations on living organisms, which falls outside the realm of marketing and strategic business decisions.",scopus-ai,0,0,Glyphosate and Roundup® Ready Effects in Hydra viridissima: New Data in an Old Issue,2023
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed the way organizations communicate, understand, and interact with their potential consumers. In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising. Several research questions are offered to guide future research on intelligent advertising to benefit ethical AI decision-making. Finally, several areas that can be widely applied to ethical intelligent advertising are suggested for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).",Rodgers W.; Nguyen T.,Strategic,10.1007/s10551-022-05048-7,AI Algorithms; Digital marketing; Ethical considerations,5.0,,10,5,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,"The abstract discusses the ethical implications of AI in advertising, outlining long-term considerations and philosophical approaches that guide decision-making.

"Objectives: Social media influencers and celebrities have traditionally been utilized by marketers. However, with the advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual influencers are gaining popularity on social media platforms. As a result, companies are compelled to incorporate this emerging trend into their social media campaigns. However, there is limited research available regarding the effectiveness criteria of virtual influencers to guide marketers in their selection decisions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, specifically within the fashion domain. Methods:. To measure the antecedents to influencing behavioral intentions, 224 online surveys were distributed to female Instagram users selected through convenience sampling method. The empirical design of the study involoved several Instagram posts created as if by a virtual influencer promoting a fictional fashion brand. These posts measured the constructs related to the research questions, drawing from validated digital human and influencer marketing literature. The collected data was analyzed using the Partial Least Squares method. Results: The study findings revealed that content informativeness, bonding, expertise, human like attributes, and consumer innovativeness all had varying degrees of influence on behavioral intentions, with content informativeness being the most influential factor. Conclusions: The study contributes to the limited literature on virtual influencers and provides novel practical implications to marketers. It also suggests the need for further in-depth studies to identify effective attributes of virtual influencers. © 2023 DSR Publishers/ The University of Jordan.",Almasri Y.,Tactical,10.35516/hum.v50i3.5420,AI influencer; CGI influencer; computer generated influencer; fashion influencer marketing; Virtual influencer,5.0,,15,0,"University of Jordan,Deanship of Scientific Research","The study investigates specific attributes of virtual influencers that impact consumer behavioral intentions, which can guide marketers in structuring their social media campaigns effectively.

"According to the sole normative foundation for trademark protection—“search costs” theory—trademarks transmit useful information to consumers, enabling an efficient marketplace. The marketplace, however, is in the midst of a fundamental change. Increasingly, retail is virtual, marketing is data-driven, and purchasing decisions are automated by AI. Predictive analytics are changing how consumers shop. Search costs theory no longer accurately describes the function of trademarks in this marketplace. Consumers now have numerous digital alternatives to trademarks that more efficiently provide them with increasingly accurate product information. Just as store shelves are disappearing from consumers’ retail experience, so are trademarks disappearing from their product search. Consumers may want to buy a product where the brand is the essential feature of the product such that the brand is the product, but they no longer need the assistance of a trademark to find the product. By reflexively continuing to protect trademarks in the name of search costs theory, courts give only lip service to consumer interests without questioning whether trademarks are fulfilling any useful information function. In many cases, trademarks may actually misinform consumers by masking the identity of the producer or its distanced relationship with the trademark owner.

"Purpose: Big data analytics allows researchers and industry practitioners to extract hidden patterns or discover new information and knowledge from big data. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the emerging big data analytics techniques, hospitality and tourism literature has shown minimal efforts to process and analyze big hospitality data through AI. Thus, this study aims to develop and compare prediction models for review helpfulness using machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze big restaurant data. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed 1,483,858 restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.com. After a thorough literature review, the study identified and added to the prediction model 4 attributes containing 11 key determinants of review helpfulness. Four ML algorithms, namely, multivariate linear regression, random forest, support vector machine regression and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were used to find a better prediction model for customer decision-making. Findings: By comparing the performance metrics, the current study found that XGBoost was the best model to predict review helpfulness among selected popular ML algorithms. Results revealed that attributes regarding a reviewer’s credibility were fundamental factors determining a review’s helpfulness. Review helpfulness even valued credibility over ratings or linguistic contents such as sentiment and subjectivity. Practical implications: The current study helps restaurant operators to attract customers by predicting review helpfulness through ML-based predictive modeling and presenting potential helpful reviews based on critical attributes including review, reviewer, restaurant and linguistic content. Using AI, online review platforms and restaurant websites can enhance customers’ attitude and purchase decision-making by reducing information overload and search cost and highlighting the most crucial review helpfulness features and user-friendly automated search results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study is the first to develop a prediction model of review helpfulness and reveal essential factors for helpful reviews. Furthermore, the study presents a state-of-the-art ML model that surpasses the conventional models’ prediction accuracy.

"Purpose: Tags help promote customer engagement on video-sharing platforms. Video tag recommender systems are artificial intelligence-enabled frameworks that strive for recommending precise tags for videos. Extant video tag recommender systems are uninterpretable, which leads to distrust of the recommendation outcome, hesitation in tag adoption and difficulty in the system debugging process. This study aims at constructing an interpretable and novel video tag recommender system to assist video-sharing platform users in tagging their newly uploaded videos. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed interpretable video tag recommender system is a multimedia deep learning framework composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which receives texts and images as inputs. The interpretability of the proposed system is realized through layer-wise relevance propagation. Findings: The case study and user study demonstrate that the proposed interpretable multimedia CNN model could effectively explain its recommended tag to users by highlighting keywords and key patches that contribute the most to the recommended tag. Moreover, the proposed model achieves an improved recommendation performance by outperforming state-of-the-art models. Practical implications: The interpretability of the proposed recommender system makes its decision process more transparent, builds users’ trust in the recommender systems and prompts users to adopt the recommended tags. Through labeling videos with human-understandable and accurate tags, the exposure of videos to their target audiences would increase, which enhances information technology (IT) adoption, customer engagement, value co-creation and precision marketing on the video-sharing platform.

"The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI.

"Nowadays, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) play an important role in different functional areas of marketing. Starting from this assumption, the main objective of this theoretical paper is to better understand the relationship between Big Data, AI, and customer journey mapping. For this purpose, the authors revised the extant literature on the impact of Big Data and AI on marketing practices to illustrate how such data analytics tools can increase the marketing performance and reduce the complexity of the pattern of consumer activity. The results of this research offer some interesting ideas for marketing managers. The proposed Big Data and AI framework to explore and manage the customer journey illustrates how the combined use of Big Data and AI analytics tools can offer effective support to decision-making systems and reduce the risk of bad marketing decision. Specifically, the authors suggest ten main areas of application of Big Data and AI technologies concerning the customer journey mapping. Each one supports a specific task, such as (1) customer profiling; (2) promotion strategy; (3) client acquisition; (4) ad targeting; (5) demand forecasting; (6) pricing strategy; (7) purchase history; (8) predictive analytics; (9) monitor consumer sentiments; and (10) customer relationship management (CRM) activities. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in various industries to provide innovative and intelligent features in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange.

"Marketing is all about finding out what your customers want and need. The information is used to create the model and improve the quality of products and services to satisfy customers. There are two major parts to a sale's planning: containing sales tactics and sales strategy. To aid in business decision-making, a data warehouse (DW) for sales collects and organizes relevant and historical data. DW is also a method for combining data from various heterogeneous databases (DB) and other sources of information for analysis. In this paper, Information analysis for dynamic Sale planning by AI Decision support process was done. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithms have been used to find optimal MVs for sale planning since several authors prove that these algorithms are better than other existing algorithms. MVs selection is based on three factors: time running of MVs, area of MVs, and access frequency of MVs by manipulating the selection result using a weighted combination of each factor as needed by the designer. For PSO, the most cost of frequency was 1.924 for View (V) 11, while for QPSO, it was 1.722 for V11. For PSO, the most cost of time was 1.931 for V2, while for QPSO, it was 1.221 for V22. For PSO, the most cost of the area was 1.800 for V17, while for QPSO, it was 1.071 for V17.

"Curiously, there are few contributions in the scientific literature on the subject of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on aeronautics. However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies.

"Background: In an effort to improve the quality of medical care, the philosophy of patient-centered care has become integrated into almost every aspect of the medical community. Despite its widespread acceptance, among patients and practitioners, there are concerns that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence may threaten elements of patient-centered care, such as personal relationships with care providers and patient-driven choices. This study explores the extent to which patients are confident in and comfortable with the use of these technologies when it comes to their own individual care and identifies areas that may align with or threaten elements of patient-centered care. Methods: An exploratory, mixed-method approach was used to analyze survey data from 600 US-based adults in the State of Florida. The survey was administered through a leading market research provider (August 10–21, 2023), and responses were collected to be representative of the state’s population based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Results: Respondents were more comfortable with the use of AI in health-related tasks that were not associated with doctor-patient relationships, such as scheduling patient appointments or follow-ups (84.2%). Fear of losing the ‘human touch’ associated with doctors was a common theme within qualitative coding, suggesting a potential conflict between the implementation of AI and patient-centered care. In addition, decision self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of comfort with AI, but there were also concerns about losing decision-making control, workforce changes, and cost concerns. A small majority of participants mentioned that AI could be useful for doctors and lead to more equitable care but only when used within limits. Conclusion: The application of AI in medical care is rapidly advancing, but oversight, regulation, and guidance addressing critical aspects of patient-centered care are lacking. While there is no evidence that AI will undermine patient-physician relationships at this time, there is concern on the part of patients regarding the application of AI within medical care and specifically as it relates to their interaction with physicians. Medical guidance on incorporating AI while adhering to the principles of patient-centered care is needed to clarify how AI will augment medical care. © The Author(s) 2024.",Witkowski K.; Okhai R.; Neely S.R.,Out of scope,10.1186/s12910-024-01066-4,Artificial intelligence; Patient-centered care; Patient-physician relationship; Public perception,,0.0,0,100,BioMed Central Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implications of AI in medical care, which falls under healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-ai,0,0,Public perceptions of artificial intelligence in healthcare: ethical concerns and opportunities for patient-centered care,2024

"Understanding how to increase satisfaction and loyalty is of interest to retailers since it has been demonstrated that loyal customers are more profitable than non-loyal ones. The extant literature demonstrated that marketing mix components can affect the satisfaction and loyalty to the retailer. These levers can be divided into two groups: micro (price differentiation, fidelity cards) and macro (price, assortment, private label, services) levers. Among macro ones, price seems to be the most important variable able to influence the selection of a retailer, the level of satisfaction and loyalty. However, customers are not able to judge the real value for money, so it is very important to analyze the perceived price image and to identify the variables on which it depends on. Previous studies have demonstrated that our perceptions, judgments and even preferences are influenced by the way decision problems are framed, so how pricing strategies are communicated is a critical element. This is true, not only for companies that face with final customers but also for wholesalers and, specifically, for Cash and Carry wholesalers, which face with final customers, restaurants and retailers. But, if on one hand, price communication has been deeply investigated in the retailing sector, the same cannot be said for what concerns wholesalers and, in particular, Cash and Carry format. For these reasons, the present work aims to analyze the impact of different ways of price communication can affect customers’ satisfaction and loyalty in the Cash and Carry format, through focus groups methodology, given the novelty of the topic. Findings could help wholesalers to more optimally communicate price promotions in order to better meet the needs of different types of customers and increase the level of satisfaction. © 2019 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

The adoption of chatbots has increased rapidly in many sectors, including, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, Supporting Systems and Marketing, and Entertainment. Chatbots have the potential to improve human interaction with machines, and NLP helps them understand human language more clearly and thus create proper and intelligent responses. In addition to classical ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) has attracted many researchers to develop chatbots using more sophisticated and accurate techniques. However, research has paid chatbots have widely been developed for English, there is relatively less research on Arabic, which is mainly due to its complexity and lack of proper corpora compared to English. Though there have been several survey studies that reviewed the state-of-the-art of chatbot systems, these studies (a) did not give a comprehensive overview of how different the techniques used for Arabic chatbots in comparison with English chatbots; and (b) paid little attention to the application of ANN for developing chatbots. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a literature survey of chatbot studies to highlight differences between (1) classical and deep ML techniques for chatbots; and (2) techniques employed for Arabic chatbots versus those for other languages. To this end, we propose various comparison criteria of the techniques, extract data from collected studies accordingly, and provide insights on the progress of chatbot development for Arabic and what still needs to be done in the future. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",Alazzam B.A.; Alkhatib M.; Shaalan K.,Not identified,10.18576/isl/120437,Arabic Language; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Deep Learning; Machine Learning,50.0,,20,5,Natural Sciences Publishing,"The abstract discusses the development and comparison of chatbot systems, particularly focusing on Arabic and English languages, but it does not clearly fit into strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing.

"Purpose: Companies utilize increasingly capable Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to deliver modern services across a range of consumer service industries. AI autonomy, however, sparks skepticism among consumers leading to a decrease in their willingness to adopt AI services. This raises the question as to whether consumer trust in companies can overcome consumer reluctance in their decisions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services. Design/methodology/approach: Using a representative survey (N = 503 consumers corresponding to N = 3,690 observations), this article investigated the link between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt high (vs low) autonomy AI services from the company across 23 consumer service companies accounting for six distinct service industries. Findings: The results confirm a significant and positive relationship between consumer trust in a company and consumers' intentions to adopt AI services from the same company. AI autonomy, however, moderates this relationship, such that high (vs low) AI autonomy weakens the positive link between trust in a company and AI service adoption. This finding replicates across all 23 companies and the associated six industries and is robust to the inclusion of several theoretically important control variables. Originality/value: The current research contributes to the recent stream of AI research by drawing attention to the interplay between trust in companies and adoption of high autonomy AI services, with implications for the successful deployment and marketing of AI services. © 2023, Darius-Aurel Frank, Lina Fogt Jacobsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard and Tobias Otterbring.",Frank D.-A.; Jacobsen L.F.; Søndergaard H.A.; Otterbring T.,Strategic,10.1108/ITP-09-2022-0721,Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Innovation adoption; Trust in the company,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the relationship between consumer trust and the adoption of AI services, which pertains to long-term organizational goals and strategies for successfully deploying AI technologies in consumer service industries.",scopus-ai,70,20,In companies we trust: consumer adoption of artificial intelligence services and the role of trust in companies and AI autonomy,2023
"Artificial intelligence (AI) can affect all of a company's functions, not least the purchasing department. In addition to automating and optimizing existing processes, AI opens up new opportunities for purchasers to undertake new, strategic, collaborative, enduring missions. AI enables complex, strategic decision-making in an unpredictable, hostile environment. This article analyzes to what extent AI can improve the performance of the purchasing department. First, a review is undertaken of how AI is used in purchasing. Thereafter, the research follows an exploratory, inductive, and qualitative approach based on a multiple case study of the following technologies: (1) the Synertrade automated international purchasing system; (2) the Silex matching system; (3) SAP Ariba decision support; (4) Jaggaer supplier relations management; and (5) the Ideapoke collaborative ideation and innovative project management platform.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have proliferated, garnering significant interest among information systems (IS) scholars. AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions.

"The exponential growth of data in the digital age has led to a significant demand for innovative approaches to assess data in a manner that is both effective and efficient. Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a category of services that offers considerable potential for organisations to extract valuable insights from their data while reducing the requirement for heavy technical expertise. This article explores the use of MLaaS within the realm of marketing applications. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of MLaaS implementations and their benefits within the domain of marketing. Furthermore, we present a platform that possesses the capability to be customised and expanded to address marketing’s unique requirements. Three modules are introduced: Churn Prediction, One-2-One Product Recommendation, and Send Frequency Prediction. When applied to marketing, the proposed MLaaS system exhibits considerable promise for use in applications such as automated detection of client churn prior to its occurrence, individualised product recommendations, and send time optimisation. Our study revealed that AI-driven campaigns can improve both the Open Rate and Click Rate. This approach has the potential to enhance customer engagement and retention for businesses while enabling well-informed decisions by leveraging insights derived from consumer data.

"Purpose: The paper examines the increase in annual income of the new middle-class (The NMC) of Delhi-NCR and its impact on their investment habits, consumption habits and lifestyle. The paper aims to look into the transformation of the new middle-class into the NMC in emerging economies and its potential to the companies and investors. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws insight from 558 new middle-class consumers in Delhi-NCR. ANOVA, post hoc tests, and hierarchical multiple linear regression model are applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The NMC living in India's megacities imitates the lifestyle of their counterparts living in the West. To maintain their status and present themselves different from those living in middle or lower-middle-class categories, they spend audaciously, even though the income is low. When they enter the new middle class, their consumption, saving and lifestyle diversify positively. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations. First, the authors do not apply any behavioral theory or marketing model such as the theory of reasoned action (TRA), Engel-kollat-Blackwell (EKB) model or theory of normative model of target markets. Second, the research is limited to the NMC of only one emerging economy, i.e., India. Third, the research sample is limited to only one megacity of India, i.e., Delhi. Finally, this research used only one factor, i.e., AI, to study the consumption pattern. Practical implications: The results suggest that considering the buying habits and lifestyle of Indian the NMC, consumers would prove helpful to the companies in product decision-making. Furthermore, understanding change in investment habits across different income levels would be advantageous to financial institutions, investment planners and marketers while designing their products to attract investment.

"Purpose: Few well-documented studies have explained the importance of researching firms' marketing analytics capability (FMAC). In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance.

The use of MSLA is validated across the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The findings show that MSLA helps (i) reveal structures in what appear to be unstructured multimodal posts; (ii) identify all the sentiment items in a post; (iii) identify implicit meanings, such as irony, humour and sarcasm; and (iv) further identify emotions and judgements in multimodal communication.

"Consumer resistance is a major barrier to diffusing radical innovation into mainstream markets. While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",Casidy R.; Claudy M.; Heidenreich S.; Camurdan E.,Strategic,10.1002/mar.21496,artificial intelligence; autonomous vehicles; brand concept; innovation; self-brand connection,5.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of consumer resistance to radical innovation and the role of branding in overcoming this resistance, aligning with strategic planning objectives.",scopus-ai,60,25,The role of brand in overcoming consumer resistance to autonomous vehicles,2021

The sample size of this research study can be expanded to include SME respondents in other geographical areas that were not considered in this study. Future research studies should concentrate on how AIM can analyze customer communications and information such as posts on social media to develop future communications that may enhance customer engagement. Practical implications: The practical implications comprise of two key items. First, this research study encourages SME owners and managers to develop an AIM method as a fundamental strategic goal in their pursuit to improve SME performance. Second, SME owners and managers should increasingly implement the four determinants of AIM indicated in this research study (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) to develop essential resources for effective application of AIM to improve their performance. Originality/value: The results of this study provide a strong support to RBV theory and the proposition that AIM and its determinants (i.e., IOT, CDMS, VAR and personalization) should be recognized as an essential strategic resource for improving the performance (i.e., financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance) of SMEs.

"Purpose: This study aims to identify and explore different risk typologies associated with consumer acceptance of purchase recommendations from voice assistants (VAs). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on components of perceived risk, consumer trust theory, and consumption value theory, a research model was proposed and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) with data from 482 voice shoppers. Findings: The results reveal that, unlike risks associated with physical harm, privacy breaches, and security threats, a variety of other concerns—including financial, psychological, social, performance-related risks, time loss, and the overall perceived risks—significantly influence consumers' willingness to accept VAs purchase recommendations. The effect is mediated by trust in VA purchase recommendations and their perceived value. Different types of risk affect various consumption values, with functional value being the most influential. The model explains 58.6% of the variance in purchase recommendation acceptance and significantly elucidates the variance in all consumption values. Originality/value: This study contributes crucial knowledge to understanding consumer decision-making processes as they increasingly leverage AI-powered voice-based dialogue platforms for online purchasing.

"An excessive amount of data is generated daily. A consumer’s journey has become ex-tremely complicated due to the number of electronic platforms, the number of devices, the information provided, and the number of providers. The need for artificial intelligence (AI) models that combine marketing data and computer science methods is imperative to classify users’ needs. This work bridges the gap between computer and marketing science by introducing the current trends of AI models on marketing data. It examines consumers’ behaviour by using a decision-making model, which analyses the consumer’s choices and helps the decision-makers to understand their potential clients’ needs. This model is able to predict consumer behaviour both in the digital and physical shopping environments. It combines decision trees (DTs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) through one wrapping technique, known as the GA wrapper method. Consumer data from surveys are collected and categorised based on the research objectives. The GA wrapper was found to perform exceptionally well, reaching classification accuracies above 90%. With regard to the Gender, the Household Size, and Household Monthly Income classes, it manages to indicate the best subsets of specific genes that affect decision making. These classes were found to be associated with a specific set of variables, providing a clear roadmap for marketing decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

"The ubiquity of chatbots continues to expand, offering a multitude of benefits for firms. While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factors—subjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trust—allows for a more holistic assessment of a firm's readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions.

"In today’s digital landscape, businesses must allocate online resources efficiently. Data-driven AI methods are increasingly adopted for customer journey management. This study enhances existing frameworks with three key propositions, integrating deep learning and optimization to create a three-step revenue optimization model using online customer data. First, we apply K-means clustering to analyze online user data, constructing a behavior model. Then, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks predict user behavior and conversion values from sequential data. Finally, the heuristic algorithm optimizes revenue within budget constraints based on conversions. From an academic perspective, our study provides an empirical, theory-grounded model for service and marketing management. Technologically, we identify three key findings: stacking LSTM with CNN effectively processes sequential online user data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods; optimization methods and decision trees improve model interpretability and address marketing attribution challenges by understanding user behavior and channel impacts; and traditional integer programming models fall short in solving high-dimensional online channel planning problems, necessitating heuristic algorithms. Our model aids companies in setting online channel standards and budgets, offering valuable insights and practical guidance to decision-makers. © 2024 the Author, licensee AIMS Press.",Wang T.-C.,Tactical,10.3934/QFE.2024001,customer journeys managements; deep learning; e-commerce platform; optimization methods,5.0,,15,0,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,"The abstract discusses the development of a revenue optimization model that uses online customer data, applying methods like K-means clustering, CNNs, and LSTMs. These activities are focused on interpreting strategic goals into structured targets, which aligns well with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as advanced targeting and attribution.",scopus-ai,10,70,Deep Learning-Based Prediction and Revenue Optimization for Online Platform User Journeys,2024
"Technology finance, which has attracted worldwide attention for the successful business development of small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups, has advanced an innovation or stagnation way-out resolution strategy for companies in line with the low-growth economic trends. Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R&D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company’s management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company’s growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm’s commercialization strategy. For the last years, the KIBO Patent Appraisal System (KPAS-II) herein proposed has been advanced by KIBO as a web-based, artificial intelligence (AI) and evaluation data applications valuation system that automatically calculates and estimates a technology’s feasible economic value by utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic index information of a patent and the commercialization entity’s business ca-pabilities, and by applying to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method in valuation theory, and finally integrating with deep learning results based on the in-advance previously established patent DB and the financial DB. The KPAS-II proposed in this study can be said to have dramatically overcome the long-term preparation period and high levels of R&D and commercialization costs in terms of the limitations that the existing technology valuation method possesses by enhancing the reliability of approximate economic values from the deep learning results based on financial data and completed valuation data. In addition, it is expected that technology marketing coordinators, researchers, and non-specialty business agents, not limited to valuation experts, can easily estimate the economic values of their patents or technologies, and they can be actively utilized in a technology-based company’s decision-making and technologically dependent financial activities. © 2021 by the authors.

"Firms are developing AI-enhanced products (e.g., robots) that can tackle environmental problems through autonomous interactions with their surroundings (e.g., removing waste/pollutants, tracking invasive species) and autonomous learning, which results in improved environmental performance characteristics. Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer's purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being. © 2020 The Author(s)",Frank B.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125242,Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental sustainability; Green purchasing; Robotics,10.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The study focuses on how perceived environmental benefits of AI-enhanced products influence consumer purchase intent, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The research was designed to contribute to scientific efforts in exploring the attitude of fashion stakeholders towards AI and its use in attaining sustainability in fashion industry. Although the role of AI in Fashion has been studied before, the aim of this research is to challenge and analyze the attitudes towards sustainable fashion of both stakeholders and consumers. The research considers the views of consumers, industry professionals and company shareholders on the role AI plays in pursuing ideas of Sustainable Fashion. Contrary to expectations, the companies with significant turnover did not show any greater awareness of the new trends in the fashion business. Furthermore, previous familiarity with the usage of AI did not prove to promote openness towards the recommendation of apps which use AI to promote Sustainable Fashion. The value of this research lies in the findings, which help provide a framework which can be used to change the viewpoint of the key market players. The crucial finding is that the AI approach on sustainability will influence both users (changing their purchasing decisions toward more sustainable choices if provided with a set of information on ecological impact, production choices), and corporate businesses (changing the overall business strategy, planning, marketing communication and production designs).

"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked interest in various areas, including marketing. However, this exhilaration is being tempered by growing concerns about the moral and legal implications of using AI in marketing. Although previous research has revealed various ethical and legal issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and data privacy, there are no definitive answers. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating AI’s ethical and legal concerns in marketing and suggesting feasible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper synthesises information from academic articles, industry reports, case studies and legal documents through a thematic literature review. A qualitative analysis approach categorises and interprets ethical and legal challenges and proposes potential solutions. Findings: The findings of this paper raise concerns about ethical and legal challenges related to AI in the marketing area. Ethical concerns related to discrimination, bias, manipulation, job displacement, absence of social interaction, cybersecurity, unintended consequences, environmental impact, privacy and legal issues such as consumer security, responsibility, liability, brand protection, competition law, agreements, data protection, consumer protection and intellectual property rights are discussed in the paper, and their potential solutions are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Notwithstanding the interesting insights gathered from this investigation of the ethical and legal consequences of AI in marketing, it is important to recognise the limits of this research. Initially, the focus of this study is confined to a review of the most important ethical and legal issues pertaining to AI in marketing. Additional possible repercussions, such as those associated with intellectual property, contracts and licencing, should be investigated more deeply in future studies. Despite the fact that this study gives various answers and best practices for tackling the stated ethical and legal concerns, the viability and efficacy of these solutions may differ depending on the context and industry. Thus, more research and case studies are required to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of these solutions in other circumstances. This research is mostly based on a literature review and may not represent the experiences or opinions of all stakeholders engaged in AI-powered marketing. Further study might involve interviews or surveys with marketing professionals, customers and other key stakeholders to offer a full knowledge of the practical difficulties and solutions. Because of the rapid speed of technical progress, AI’s ethical and regulatory ramifications in marketing are continually increasing. Consequently, this work should be a springboard for more research and continuing conversations on this subject. Practical implications: This study’s findings have several practical implications for marketing professionals. Emphasising openness and explainability: Marketing professionals should prioritise transparency in their use of AI, ensuring that customers are fully informed about data collection and utilisation for targeted advertising. By promoting openness and explainability, marketers can foster customer trust and avoid the negative consequences of a lack of transparency. Establishing ethical guidelines: Marketing professionals need to develop ethical rules for the creation and implementation of AI-powered marketing strategies. Adhering to ethical principles ensures compliance with legal norms and aligns with the organisation’s values and ideals. Investing in bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology: To mitigate risks associated with AI in marketing, marketers should allocate resources to develop and implement bias detection tools and privacy-enhancing technology. These tools can identify and address biases in AI algorithms, safeguard consumer privacy and extract valuable insights from consumer data. Social implications: This study’s social implications emphasise the need for a comprehensive approach to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI in marketing. This includes adopting a responsible innovation framework, promoting ethical leadership, using ethical decision-making frameworks and conducting multidisciplinary research. By incorporating these approaches, marketers can navigate the complexities of AI in marketing responsibly, foster an ethical organisational culture, make informed ethical decisions and develop effective solutions. Such practices promote public trust, ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk, and mitigate potential negative social consequences associated with AI in marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is among the first to explore potential solutions comprehensively. This paper provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges by using a multidisciplinary framework and synthesising various sources.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are pervasive in the travel industry and have significantly alleviated solo travelers' concerns in trip planning and booking. However, many existing AI chatbots have yet to meet the expectations of solo travelers, especially when they demand more personalized information to assist in travel decision-making. Based on complexity theory, this research examines the factors that stimulate solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, particularly covering the three main aspects of marketing efforts, communication quality, and affective characteristics. Drawing from a sample of 281 solo travelers, partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) are used to examine the proposed relationships. The PLS-SEM results illustrate that interaction, entertainment, trendiness, communication competence, and satisfaction have significant direct effects on purchase intentions. The fsQCA results further revealed four solutions exhibiting high purchase intentions among solo travelers. Different core, peripheral, and necessary causal conditions in each configuration path were identified. The findings enrich the AI chatbot literature by examining the underlying reasons why solo travelers react differently to this emerging technology and produce practical recommendations for designing AI chatbot systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Chang J.Y.-S.; Cheah J.-H.; Lim X.-J.; Morrison A.M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tmp.2023.101191,AI chatbot; fsQCA; PLS-SEM; Purchase intentions; Solo travelers; Tourism,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on specific factors that influence solo travelers' purchase intentions when using AI chatbots, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The introduction of AI-based technologies has dramatically altered the premises for consumer privacy, enabling the unprecedented manipulation of consumers’ decision-making online. Given these recent threats to consumer privacy and autonomy, and considering autonomy as the ultimate outcome of privacy, I propose that a reconceptualization is warranted to reflect contemporary consumer privacy challenges and to realign the concept with its theoretical foundations. To this end, I introduce the dimension of decisional privacy, focused on autonomy versus interference in consumer decision-making. Building on previous privacy literature and extending previous theorizing about information privacy and decisional privacy as complementary, I posit that these two dimensions of privacy together comprise consumer privacy. Addressing protection from interference as an under-communicated function of consumer privacy, the paper aims to clarify, exemplify, and engage in the conceptual development of decisional privacy in the context of consumer decision-making online. In addition to its significance for consumer wellbeing and democracy collectively, the extension of consumer privacy to explicitly encompass interference has theoretical implications for privacy concern, the proxy used to measure privacy, yielding important insights for marketing scholars and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2024.",Bjørlo L.V.,Strategic,10.1007/s13162-024-00273-x,Autonomy; Consumer privacy; Decisional privacy; Privacy; Privacy concerns,10.0,,10,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses the need for a reconceptualization of consumer privacy in light of AI technologies and their implications for autonomy and decision-making.

"A popular joke amongst marketers is that the best place to hide a dead body is page two of search results. Meaning, nobody looks beyond the first page of search results. In a cookie-free future, search engines double down on how marketers communicate expertise, authority, and trust. This pushes brands to shift away from product-focused search engine marketing, toward an intent-based approach. To stay at the top of search engine results, marketers must understand consumer assessment of search results. Guided by an integrated framework combining UTAUT2, theory of reasoned action, and media richness theory, this empirical study used a 2 (search result type: organic vs. sponsored) × 3 (presentation format: text-only vs. image vs. video) between-subjects research design for assessing the effects of search results on consumer decisions.

"Purpose: This research examines whether anthropomorphizing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots alters consumers' risk preferences toward financial investment options involving differential risks. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1).

"When do consumers trust artificial intelligence (AI)? With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI-generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision-making literature.

"The insurance industry is being challenged by increased adoption of automated decision-making. AI advances could conceivably automate everything: marketing, customer service, underwriting and claims management alike. However, such automation challenges consumer trust, as there is considerable public and scholarly debate over the ‘black box’ character of many algorithms. Insurance being a business of trust, this suggests a dilemma. One suggested solution involves adopting algorithms in a transparent manner. This article reports a study of how Swedish insurers deal with this dilemma, based on (i) eight interviews with insurance professionals representing four companies with a joint market share of 45–50% of the Swedish property insurance market and (ii) a questionnaire answered by 71 professionals in a Swedish insurance company. The results show that while transparency is seen as potentially valuable, most Swedish insurers do not use it to gain a competitive advantage or identify clear limits to transparency and are not using AI extensively. © 2021, The Geneva Association.",Dexe J.; Franke U.; Rad A.,Tactical,10.1057/s41288-021-00207-9,Competitive advantage; Insurance; Openness; Sweden; Transparency; Trust,5.0,,20,5,Palgrave Macmillan,"The abstract discusses how Swedish insurers are dealing with the implementation of AI and transparency in decision-making processes, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"This case stems from a 2019 scenario at Caspar Technologies Pvt. Ltd., a rapidly growing digital marketing and automation service provider in India. CEO Jacob faced concern after presenting to a major client, Pragati, the founder of Villuvia.com, one of India’s top online jewellery brands. While email marketing had been a core strategy since the beginning, its return on investment had dwindled compared to social media advertising, exacerbated by a recent overhaul introducing a new digital marketing team. They excelled in social media but were new to email marketing software. Caspar Technologies unveiled cMercury, an AI-based technology to streamline email marketing campaigns. Although initial tests showed promise, it came at a five-fold cost compared to traditional email management software, which demanded extensive manual intervention. Jacob considered offering Villuvia a discount for the festive season but awaited Pragati’s decision. This would determine whether their budget would be allocated to email marketing, social media, or offline expansion.

"Purpose: Digital transformations are altering service models and care delivery methods in healthcare. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next wave of transformation in healthcare. This study aims to understand patient perceptions of AI and its impact on value co-creation. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate how value co-creation operant resources (digital self-efficacy and relational service quality) impact value co-creation engagement (shared decision-making) and value co-creation outcomes (anticipatory AI value co-creation and intention to adopt AI). Data were collected from 332 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that the value co-creation process for AI technologies is a function of inputs, experiences and AI outputs. Operant resources were found to be positively associated with shared decision-making. However, not all operant resources directly and positively impacted AI outcomes. The indirect and positive mediated relationships through shared decision-making to AI outcomes suggest an interactive AI value co-creation process. Research limitations/implications: AI technologies are still in early stages of consumer adoption in healthcare. Future research is warranted that investigates the validity of the model through maturing service life cycles. Practical implications: Customer perceptions of new digital innovations are formed in the context of previous digital experiences. Marketers need to understand how customers view their current non-AI technologies. Strong engagement and perceived value of current technologies will help ease customers into the usage of AI technologies.

"The research conducted aimed to determine the most attractive digital marketing technologies for future investment opportunities. This was achieved through a cross-priority ranking analysis, which identified trends in the development of digital technologies in marketing communications and global marketing. Data from 25 expert organisations was used to form a set of 32 digital solutions. Using a developed methodology, these solutions were ranked, revealing the top 6 with the highest potential for transforming marketing communications. The rankings showed a discrepancy between the mentioned frequency ranking and the priority ranking, indicating the influence of marketing organizations' experience. Currently, social media platforms, particularly influencer marketing, are closely integrated with e-commerce, explaining their high mention frequency. However, a cross-ranking analysis revealed a trend towards AI technologies in marketing communications processes. It has been established that obtaining credit funds for the deployment of modernized marketing campaigns and strategies impacts the financial security of such organizations. Moreover, the utilization of optimal conversion-oriented digital marketing tools allows for a significant reduction in financial risks and an increase in the profitability of companies. The study further identified the future direction of global marketing development, which involves immersive strategies that deeply integrate and extensively use AI technologies. These strategies aim to enhance consumer interest and engagement. The practicality of this research lies in its ability to assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions and reducing the risks of misdirected investments.

Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived.

"The increasing use of digital technologies has significantly reshaped marketing and consumer behavior (CB) as online communities and cutting-edge innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) disrupt and advance consumer attitudes on specific products and services. As such, online communities that are supported by AI technologies creating new knowledge from consumer interactions through platforms like social media as consumers share experiences on specific products or services. Since AI is designed to &#x201C;learn&#x201D; and improve with data generated from digital technologies linked to consumer interactions, AI relies on consumer knowledge-sharing (KS) activities to replicate new knowledge for product and service improvement. However, given the knowledge gap in this area, this article applies the fsQCA technique to data generated from 291 participants to develop CB metaframework predicted on the concepts of AI, CB, and KS. Our results suggest that AI advances consumer attitudes and behaviors when knowledge is acquired while online communities promote curiosity and engage consumers to learn by sharing experiences about specific products or services.

"In this article we develop a comprehensive understanding of diverse representation in advertising. While numerous studies highlight increasing demand for diversity among some consumers, such enthusiasm is not universal. This is creating challenges for brands, some of which have faced backlash, either due to a perceived lack of authenticity in their diversity efforts or because not all consumer groups value diversity equally. Amidst these challenges, technological advancements, such as data-driven decision-making and generative AI, present both new opportunities and risks. The current literature on diverse representation in advertising, although expansive, is relatively siloed. Through a detailed eight-step process, we assess and synthesize the body of literature on diversity representation, reviewing 337 articles spanning research on age, beauty, body size, gender, LGBTQIA+ , physical and mental ability, and race and ethnicity. Our investigation offers two major contributions: a summarization of insights from the broader literature on these seven key areas of diverse representation and development of an integrated conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework details mechanisms, moderators, and outcomes that are either prevalent across the literature or can be reasonably expected to generalize across other forms of diversity.

"Purpose: This paper aims to document how AI has changed the way consumers make decisions and propose how that change impacts services marketing, service research and service management. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. Findings: Today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. The authors propose that AI has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. By using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. At the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to AI. Therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers’ decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. Research limitations/implications: In an AI-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. Customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as AI, bots. Hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model.

"Since neuroscience broke into the field of marketing at the beginning of the 21st century, it has been proven that consumers base a large part of their daily decisions on their feelings, based on stimuli that move them rather than solely relying on conscious and rational factors. The research presents a case analysis of an award-winning Spot that uses artificial intelligence as the basis of the creative idea. Its objective is to assess the extent to which the implementation of this resource is pertinent in eliciting emotions, influencing brand awareness and perception, and fostering a favorable attitude towards the brand. For the analysis, a neuromarketing technique has been used, the Implicit Association Test, complemented with in-depth interviews and a CAWI survey.

"There is a growing debate amongst academics and practitioners on whether interventions made, thus far, towards Responsible AI have been enough to engage with the root causes of AI problems. Failure to effect meaningful changes in this system could see these initiatives not reach their potential and lead to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their marketing campaigns. Systems thinking is often touted as a methodology to manage and effect change; however, there is little practical advice available for decision-makers to include systems thinking insights to work towards Responsible AI. Using the notion of ‘leverage zones’ adapted from the systems thinking literature, we suggest a novel approach to plan for and experiment with potential initiatives and interventions. This paper presents a conceptual framework called the Five Ps to help practitioners construct and identify holistic interventions that may work towards Responsible AI, from lower-order interventions such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating parameters, through to higher-order interventions such as redefining the system’s foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in the first place.

"Extant communication theories predate the explosion of digital formats and technological advances such as virtual reality, which likely explains their predominant focus on traditional and format-level (e.g., face-to-face, email) rather than digital or characteristic-level (e.g., visual cues, synchronicity) design decisions. Firms thus lack insights into how to create and use emerging digital formats, individually or synergistically. To establish a holistic framework of bilateral multiformat communication for relationship marketing, this article reviews communication theory to establish a foundation for understanding multiformat communication and to identify any gaps (e.g., AI agents, simulated cues). The authors then review bilateral communication research in light of the identified theoretical gaps, to inform their framework. Finally, by decomposing these formats according to six fundamental characteristics, they predict how each characteristic might promote effective, efficient, and experiential communication goals, in light of distinct message, temporal, and dyadic factors. Ultimately, these combined insights reveal an overarching framework, with characteristic-level propositions grouped into five key themes, that can serve as a platform for academics and managers to develop multiformat communication theory and relationship strategies. © 2020, Academy of Marketing Science.",Moffett J.W.; Folse J.A.G.; Palmatier R.W.,Strategic,10.1007/s11747-020-00750-2,Communication strategy; Multichannel communication; Multiformat communication; Online relationships; Simulated cues,5.0,,10,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the establishment of a holistic framework for multiformat communication in relationship marketing, emphasizing long-term insights and strategies for combining emerging digital formats.

"Few key skills among many that are needed in the 21st century are critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, meta cognitive skills, technology literacy and decision making under uncertainty. With the emergence of ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools, there is a dire need for a distinctive way of learning and application of learning to ensure learning effectiveness. Mere content is no longer the most important factor to learn these skills but. what is needed is the ability to retrieve material learnt, in the context of application. For the learner to be able to apply the critical thinking levels and higher learning levels of Blooms taxonomy, the basic first level of remembering forms the basic foundation, particularly when the students are from first generation educated families or with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. However, when students cram for the exams, they generally get an ‘illusion of learning’, where they think they know, but in reality often they may not be able to recall what they crammed when they need it later. This is a case of inefficient investment of time and effort in learning for the student.

This promotes faster growth through differentiated customer investment. It ensures that the highest return initiatives are prioritized. Enterprises using this disciplined three-step approach will be well positioned to better understand value potential, creating value, delivering value, and managing their market position to maximize the value they capture. Originality/value: Mastering the value cycle enables enterprises to win in both the customer markets and the financial markets. In short, it leads them to long-term profitable growth. Take the example of a commercial printer which had traditionally played in the procure and produce step of the print value chain associated with retail inserts. Retail inserts are one of the primary demand generation vehicles for retailers, who use these to drive store traffic. One retailer saw their store traffic drop by 20 percent over a one-month period after they decided to stop printing inserts. In this value chain print was fast becoming a commodity and, like its competitors, the company was looking for growth strategy amidst declining margins. An analysis of the value chain (see Table AI) revealed that while the print component of the value chain was fast being commoditized, value was pooling at the front of the value chain with the players who delivered the insert to the end customers. The pain experienced by the retailers was so high that they committed to co-developing a solution that would introduce a discontinuity in the value chain and redirect the pooling of value back to other participants of the value chain. The printer managed to escape the commodity trap and position itself towards profitable growth. Ashish Kothari is a Principal with Charter Consulting.

"Because of the big volume of marketing data, a human analyst would be unable to uncover any useful information for marketing that could aid in the process of making decision. Smart Data Mining (SDM), which is considered an important field from Artificial Intelligence (AI) is completely assisting in the performance business management analytics and marketing information. In this study, most reliable six algorithms in SDM are applied; Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ID3, and C4.5 on actual data of marketing for bank that taken from Cloud Internet of Thing (CIoT). The objectives of this study are to build an efficient framework to increase campaign of marketing for banks by identifying main characteristics that affect a success and to test the performance of CIoT and SDM algorithms. This study is expected to enhance the scientific contributions to investigating the marketing information capacities by integrating SDM with CIoT. The performances of SDM algorithms are calculated by eight measures; accuracy, balance accuracy, precision, mean absolute error, root mean absolute error, recall, F1- Score and running time. The experimental findings show that the proposed framework is successful, with higher accuracies and good performance. Results revealed that customer service & marketing tactics are essential for a Company’ success & survival. Also, the C4.5 has accomplished better achievement than the SVM, RF, LR, NB, & ID3. At the end, CIoT Platform was evaluated by response time, request rate & processing of bank data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Liu Y.; Alzahrani I.R.; Jaleel R.A.; Sulaie S.A.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103121,Analysis; Artificial intelligence (AI); CIoT; Data of bank; Marketing; SDM,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the application of Smart Data Mining (SDM) algorithms to enhance marketing efforts for banks by identifying key characteristics that influence campaign success.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) agents driven by machine learning algorithms are rapidly transforming the business world, generating heightened interest from researchers. In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Ma L.; Sun B.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.04.005,Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data; Digital marketing; Interpretation; Machine learning; Marketing theory; Network; Prediction; Tracking data; Unstructured data,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of integrating machine learning methods into marketing research, outlining a multi-faceted research agenda and proposing research priorities that influence the overall direction of marketing practices.

"Purpose – This study aims to report on an investigation into decision-making leading to a UK firm’s first export order. It demonstrates the application of appreciative inquiry (AI) as an underutilised research method in marketing investigations. Design/methodology/approach – An AI research approach was undertaken in a firm that had not started exporting at the commencement of the study whereby the interventionist approach allowed the management team to overcome negative perceptions in their decision-making. From a research perspective, marketing decision-making could be understood in real time as opposed to in hindsight. Findings – While the key decision-maker is likely to be the owner/manager in small newly internationalising firms, a variety of factors will affect the decision to start exporting including the influence of the management team. In particular, the management team’s perceptions towards a combination of effectuation- and causation-based decision-making where risk/reward considerations in exploiting various international marketing opportunities are undertaken in light of perceived affordable losses, as well as against evolving objectives. Originality/value – The contribution is to demonstrate the AI methodology, which to date has received attention in management domains other than marketing; it offers an interventionist approach to help managers overcome barriers and move positively forward in decision-making. It offers researchers an opportunity to understand marketing decision-making in real time. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Crick D.; Crick J.,Strategic,10.1108/QMR-01-2015-0001,Appreciative inquiry; Export; Internationalisation; Marketing,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The study focuses on decision-making processes related to a firm's first export order, which involves long-term strategic planning and overcoming barriers in international marketing.

"Purpose: The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Wamba-Taguimdje S.-L.; Fosso Wamba S.; Kala Kamdjoug J.R.; Tchatchouang Wanko C.E.,Strategic,10.1108/BPMJ-10-2019-0411,Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the influence of AI on firm performance and the business value of AI-enabled transformation projects, focusing on long-term organizational goals and capabilities, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-ai,60,20,Influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on firm performance: the business value of AI-based transformation projects,2020
"This study investigates the strategic alignment between marketing and information technology (IT) strategies and provides production and operations decision makers a model for improving operational performance. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the combined strategies were used to develop a novel decision-making framework. The hypothesised relationships of an SEM model are validated with data collected from 242 managers from various industries. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based method is developed using artificial neural networks (ANN) feeding into a decision-making framework which explores the optimality of the combined strategies. The results indicate that (a) IT strategy is positively mediated by marketing strategy on performance and (b) the organisational structure moderates the mediation of marketing strategy on performance. The analysis confirms that the extracted strategies based on the proposed framework have superior performance compared to existing strategies. This paper contributes to the literature by conceptualising and empirically testing the mediation role of marketing strategy on IT strategy, performance and operational decision-making. The use of a novel three-phase decision-making framework which uses AI processes improves operational efficiency, increases insights and enhances the decision accuracy of complex problems at the strategic level in industries such as manufacturing. It could help operations executives to apply effective decisions. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Purpose: In spite of the merits of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and social media, harm to consumers has prompted calls for AI auditing/certification. Understanding consumers’ approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies’ choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on “who should certify AI” from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications. © 2023, Myrthe Blösser and Andrea Weihrauch.",Blösser M.; Weihrauch A.,Strategic,10.1108/EJM-01-2023-0009,AI certification; AI regulation; Artificial intelligence; Consumer trust; Fair AI,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Publishing,"The study explores consumer perspectives on AI certification and its implications for businesses and policymakers, aligning with long-term organizational goals and strategic decision-making.",scopus-ai,60,20,"A consumer perspective of AI certification – the current certification landscape, consumer approval and directions for future research",2024

"Purpose: This paper examines the relationship between marketing automation emergence and the marketers' use of heuristics in their decision-making processes. Heuristics play a role for the integration of human decision-making models and automation in augmentation processes, particularly in marketing where automation is widespread. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes qualitative data about the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics in decision-making models, and it is based on evidence collected from interviews with twenty-two experienced marketers. Findings: Marketers make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks. While the adoption of new automatic marketing tools modify the task environment and field of use of traditional decision-making models, the adoption of heuristics rules with a different scope is essential to defining inputs, interpreting/evaluating outputs and control the marketing automation system. Originality/value: The paper makes a contribution to research on the relationship between marketing automation and decision-making models. In particular, it proposes the results of in-depth interviews with senior decision makers to assess the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics as decision-making models adopted by marketers. © 2023, Simone Guercini.",Guercini S.,Tactical,10.1108/MD-07-2022-0909,AI in marketing; In depth interviews; Marketers' decision-making models; Marketing automation; Scope of heuristics,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The paper focuses on how marketers utilize heuristics within decision-making processes impacted by marketing automation, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-ai,15,65,Marketing automation and the scope of marketers' heuristics,2023
