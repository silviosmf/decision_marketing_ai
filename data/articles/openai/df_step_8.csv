"One of the key problems in database marketing is the identification and profiling of households that are most likely to be interested in a particular product or service. Principal component analysis (PCA) of customer background information followed by logistic regression analysis of response behavior is commonly used by database marketers. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) guided by genetic algorithms (GAs) to target households. We show that the resulting selection rule is more accurate and more parsimonious than the PCA/logit rule when the manager has a clear decision criterion. Under vague decision criteria, the new procedure loses its advantage in interpretability, but is still more accurate than PCA/logit in targeting households. ©2005 INFORMS.",Kim Y.; Street W.N.; Russell G.J.; Menczer F.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.1040.0296,Customer relationship management; Database marketing; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses a method for targeting households using advanced analytics techniques, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"As part of the increasing efforts toward the prevention and control of motor vehicle pollution, the Chinese government has practiced a range of policies to stimulate the purchase and use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Zhejiang Province, a key province in China, has proactively implemented and monitored an environmental protection plan. This study aims to contribute toward streamlining marketing and planning activities to introduce strategic policies that stimulate the purchase and use of BEVs. This study considers the nature of human behavior by extending the theory of planned behavior model to identify its predictors, as well as its non-linear relationship with customers' purchase intention. To better understand the predictors, a substantial literature review was given to validate the hypotheses. A quantitative study using 382 surveys completed by customers in Zhejiang Province was conducted by integrating a structural equation model (SEM) and a neural network (NN). The initial analysis results from the SEM revealed five factors that have impacted the customers' purchase intention of BEVs. In the second phase, the normalized importance among those five significant predictors was ranked using the NN. The findings have provided theoretical implications to scholars and academics, and managerial implications to enterprises, and are also helpful for decision makers to implement appropriate policies to promote the purchase intention of BEVs, thereby improving the air quality. © 2019 by the authors.",Xu Y.; Zhang W.; Bao H.; Zhang S.; Xiang Y.,Strategic,10.3390/su11113164,Battery electric vehicles; Neural network; Purchase intention; Structural equation model; Theory of planned behavior,5.0,,5,0,MDPI,"The study aims to contribute toward the long-term planning and strategic policies to stimulate the purchase and use of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), indicating a focus on overarching goals and the nature of environmental protection in the context of vehicle pollution.",scopus-neural network,70,20,A SEM-neural network approach to predict customers' intention to purchase battery electric vehicles in China's Zhejiang Province,2019
"Abstract Mobile-enabled location-based services are generating a huge amount of customer checkin data every day. It is vital to understand how small businesses, like restaurants, use this real-time data to make better-informed business operation decisions in this mobile marketing era. Using data collected from Foursquare, a leading location-based service provider, and Yelp, we aim to find out the predictive power of customer checkins on business failure of restaurants in New York City by using several predictive modeling techniques, such as Neural Network, Logit model and K-nearest neighbor. Our findings are encouraging. The customer checkin data from both a focal restaurant and its neighbors have shown strong predictive power on business failure. Compared to the baseline model in which we only use business characteristic variables to predict failure, incorporating the checkin data captured from location-based services gives a remarkable improvement on predictive accuracy. Our findings provide the foundation for future studies on the predictive power of information obtained from location-based services on business operations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Wang L.; Gopal R.; Shankar R.; Pancras J.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2015.04.010,K-nearest neighbor; Location-based services; Logit model; Neural network; Predictive modeling,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier,"The abstract discusses how businesses can leverage customer check-in data to make informed operational decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"User reviews are now an essential source of information for consumers, exerting strong influence on purchase decisions. Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing. The findings extend the literature on online reviews, word-of-mouth, and text analysis in marketing, and offer practical implications for marketing communication and facilitation of reviews. © 2023 Society for Consumer Psychology.",Park S.K.; Song T.; Sela A.,Tactical,10.1002/jcpy.1382,neural network; online reviews; subjectivity; text analysis; word-of-mouth,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract discusses how linguistic characteristics of consumer reviews affect their helpfulness, which pertains to structured decision-making in marketing communications and optimization of review strategies.

"This study aims to identify factors influencing consumer purchasing decision for imported ready-to-eat foods by investigating marketing factors and lifestyles in China (Beijing and Shanghai) using comparative models. Consumers in each city showed different specific lifestyles but shared consumption culture and traditions in common. Regarding lifestyles, consumers who usually buy instant food products face long commutes to work and prefer less cooking time were more likely to buy imported ready-to-eat foods. Findings suggest that product development, labelling with quality guarantees, packaging design, the production process, and multichannels are the prominent factors persuading Chinese consumers to purchase imported ready-to-eat products. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Lilavanichakul A.; Chaveesuk R.; Kessuvan A.,Tactical,10.1080/10599231.2018.1525250,artificial neural network; China; consumer purchasing decision; lifestyles; logistic regression; marketing factors; ready-to-eat foods,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study focuses on specific factors influencing consumer purchasing decisions for imported ready-to-eat foods, which aligns with structured decision-making and targets that are typical of tactical marketing efforts.",scopus-neural network,10,70,Classifying Consumer Purchasing Decision for Imported Ready-to-Eat Foods in China Using Comparative Models,2018
"To explore the minimization of the marketing cost and the maximization of the user perceived utility, an optimization model for mobile banking adoption with incomplete information is developed. A combination of qualitative simulation and empirical study can serve as a solution to the optimization problem. Firstly, we use mobile banking system as an example with questionnaire designed to obtain data from customers, which is then statistically analyzed using SPSS to examine the interactions among adoption drivers. Secondly, a qualitative simulation method is introduced to drive the evolution of the interactions among these adoption drivers. Thirdly, according to the empirical relations, an optimization model is established, and the objective functions are examined by the BP neural network. Then, to examine the feasibility of the framework, a prototype system based on MATLAB is implemented. It is found that the results are consistent with common sense (oscillation-equilibrium theory), and the framework is able to contribute to real-time optimization decision supports in the mobile banking marketing. In practice, the identification of the optimal combination of change directions can serve as the development priorities in adoption drivers, and is likely to influence resource allocation in the future mobile banking development. © JASSS.",Wei X.; Hu B.; Carley K.M.,Tactical,10.18564/jasss.2222,BP neural network; Empirical study; Mobile banking adoption; Optimization; QSIM,5.0,,15,0,University of Surrey,"The abstract discusses an optimization model for mobile banking adoption that involves analyzing drivers of adoption and creating a framework for real-time decision support.

"The study of brand choice decisions with multiple alternatives has been successfully modelled for more than a decade using the Multinomial Logit model. Recently, neural network modelling has received increasing attention and has been applied to an array of marketing problems such as market response or segmentation. We show that a Feedforward Neural Network with Softmax output units and shared weights can be viewed as a generalization of the Multinomial Logit model. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the ability of neural networks to model non-linear preferences with few (if any) a priori assumptions about the nature of the underlying utility function, while the Multinomial Logit can suffer from a specification bias. Being complementary, these approaches are combined into a single framework. The neural network is used as a diagnostic and specification tool for the Logit model, which will provide interpretable coefficients and significance statistics. The method is illustrated on an artificial dataset where the market is heterogeneous. We then apply the approach to panel scanner data of purchase records, using the Logit to analyse the non-linearities detected by the neural network.

"With the development of mobile Web technologies, people can easily seek advice from social media before making purchases or decisions. Some companies employ expert writers to fabricate reviews or use automated techniques to improve the appeal of their products or services, or to undermine the credibility of their rivals. This obstructs the detection of fake reviews and reviewers. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based framework for detecting spammers, who originate fake reviews in discussion forums to capture information from different social network combinations in various subgraphs. These subgraphs include a complete social context graph, homogeneous user–user subgraph, and heterogeneous user–post subgraph. A novel two-stage architecture with focal loss was designed to create a training model. This model can be applied to solve the issue of imbalance data classification. The proposed framework was applied to evaluate a ground truth dataset collected from an actual fraudulent review event on a discussion forum. The experimental results show that this aggregate social context representation method can be effectively applied to detect fake reviewers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Cheng L.-C.; Wu Y.T.; Chao C.-T.; Wang J.-H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2023.114150,eWOM marketing; Fake review detection; Graph neural network; Social context,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the development of a framework for detecting fake reviews, which is focused on specific methodologies and techniques applicable to marketing and social media engagement.

"Despite being one of the most symbolic, important, involving, costly, exciting, uncertain and complicated decisions most consumers make each year, holiday purchasing has received relatively little academic treatment in the service marketing literature. By extending and refining previous work, this study examines the usefulness of perceived risk theory to understand consumers' behaviour in one of the most common holiday experiences, the package holiday. Unlike other studies, this research undertakes a more detailed assessment of the risks involved, as well as examining how consumers reduce those risks. Forty-three risky attributes and fifteen risk reducers were identified and a neural network analysis uncovered a relationship between risk and risk reduction which involved functional, financial and hotel dominated risks, whilst the relationship between risk and purchase intention was mediated by trust in the tour operator and anxiety. The paper explores the nature of the risk in the holiday product and discusses how perceived risk can be measured and used by travel marketers in further research.

"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the value of Facebook data in predicting first-time donation behavior. More specifically, we provide evidence that Facebook data can be used as a valuable data source for nonprofit organizations in acquiring new donors. To do so, we evaluate three different dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., singular value decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization, and latent Dirichlet allocation) over seven classification techniques (i.e., logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, bagged trees, random forest, adaboost, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks) using five times twofold cross-validation. Next, we assess what type of Facebook data and which predictors are most important. The results indicate that we can predict first-time donation behavior based on Facebook data with high predictive performance. Our benchmark indicates that the combination of singular value decomposition and logistic regression outperforms all other analytical methodologies with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 and a top decile lift of 3.33. The results show that Facebook pages and categories of Facebook pages are the most important data types. The most important predictors are dimensions related to age, education, residence, materialism, responsible consumption, and interest in nonprofits. The presented acquisition models can be used by nonprofit organizations to implement a one-to-one targeted marketing campaign towards Facebook fans. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the predictive value of Facebook data for nonprofits in a real-life acquisition context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Schetgen L.; Bogaert M.; Van den Poel D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2020.113446,CRM; Customer acquisition; Facebook; Predictive analytics; Social media,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The study focuses on utilizing Facebook data to predict first-time donation behavior for nonprofits, which aligns with tactical decision-making such as advanced targeting, customer acquisition, and marketing analytics.

"Purpose: Recent studies have observed rise in consumer’s ethical concerns about the online retailers while making a purchase decision. The impetus for businesses to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evident, but the effects of CSR motives on corresponding processes underlying cause-related marketing (CRM) patronage intention have not been thoroughly examined. This study, anchored on attribution theory, established a research model that better explains the influence of CSR motives on patronage intentions toward CRM-oriented online retailers. Additionally, this study aims to examine the moderating role of spirituality (SPT) on CSR motives and CRM patronage intention (CPI). Design/methodology/approach: Primary data has been collected from 722 respondents and analyzed by using deep neural-network architecture by using the innovative PLS-SEM-ANN method to predict/rank the factors impacting CPI. Findings: The results revealed the normalized importance of the predictors of CPI and found that value-driven motive was the strongest predictor, followed by strategic motive, SPT, age and stakeholder-driven motive. In contrast, egoistic motive, education and income were found insignificant. Originality/value: The pandemic has transformed the way consumers shop and fortified the online economy, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift toward usage of e-commerce platforms. The results offer valuable insights to online retailers and practitioners for predicting patronage intentions by CSR motives and, thus, effectively engage CRM consumers by designing promotions in a way that would deeply resonate with them. This study assessed and predicted the factors influencing the CPI s, thereby guiding the online retailers to design CSR strategies and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Suryavanshi A.K.S.; Bhatt V.; Thomas S.; Patel R.; Jariwala H.,Strategic,10.1108/SRJ-12-2022-0564,Cause-related marketing; CRM patronage intentions; CSR motives; PLS-SEM-ANN; Spirituality,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study focuses on the long-term implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR) motives and their influence on consumer patronage intentions in online retailing, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",scopus-neural network,60,25,"Predicting cause-related marketing patronage intentions, corporate social responsibility motives and moderating role of spirituality",2024
"Leasing is a popular channel for marketing new cars. However, the pricing of leases is complicated because the leasing rate must embody an expectation of the car's residual value after contract expiration. This paper develops resale price forecasting models in order to aid pricing decisions. One feature of the leasing business is that different forecast errors entail different costs. The primary objective of this paper is to identify effective ways of addressing cost asymmetry. Specifically, this paper contributes to the literature by (i) consolidating prior work in forecasting on asymmetric functions of the cost of errors; (ii) systematically evaluating previous approaches and comparing them to a new approach; and (iii) demonstrating that forecasting using asymmetric cost of error functions improves the quality of decision support in car leasing. For example, if the costs of overestimating resale prices are twice those of underestimating them, incorporating cost asymmetry into forecast model development reduces costs by about 8%. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters",Dress K.; Lessmann S.; von Mettenheim H.-J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.01.008,Asymmetric cost of error; Automotive industry; Ensemble learning; Neural networks; Quantile regression,5.0,,5,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The paper focuses on developing forecasting models to aid pricing decisions in car leasing, indicating long-term strategic planning to improve decision support systems related to pricing and residual value expectations.",scopus-neural network,70,20,Residual value forecasting using asymmetric cost functions,2018
"Nowadays, websites use a variety of recommendation systems to decide the content to display to their visitors. In this work, we use a multiarmed bandit approach to dynamically select the combination of house ads to exhibit to a heterogeneous set of customers visiting the website of a large retailer. House ads correspond to promotional information displayed on the website to highlight some specific products and are an important marketing tool for online retailers. As the number of clicks they receive not only depends on their own attractiveness but also on how attractive are other products displayed around them, we decide about complete collections of ads that capture those interactions. More-over, as ads can wear out, in our recommendations we allow for nonstationary rewards. Furthermore, considering the sparsity of customer-level information, we embed a deep neural network to provide personalized recommendations within a bandit scheme. We tested our methods in controlled experiments where we compared them against decisions made by an experienced team of managers and the recommendations of a variety of other bandit policies. Our results show a more active exploration of the decision space and a sig-nificant increment in click-through and add-to-cart rates. © 2022 INFORMS.",Aramayo N.; Schiappacasse M.; Goic M.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2022.1378,deep learning; house ads; multiarmed bandits; personalization,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract describes a method for dynamically selecting house ads on a retailer's website, which involves structured decision-making processes that align with specific marketing targets and goals.

"India has become one of the world's largest gaming destinations, and in the last few years, the rapid rise of online gaming has led to the domination of fantasy sports gaming platforms. Very little is understood about how users on fantasy sports gaming platforms perceive and approach giving and what essentially matters to users before selecting or engaging with such fantasy sports gaming platforms. This study aims to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards fantasy sports gaming platforms by examining philanthropic actions, well-being (WB) and flow experience (FE). A large-scale research study on 2091 samples was undertaken by adopting three-fold SEM-ANN-NCA (structural equation modeling-artificial neural network-necessary condition analysis) for establishing and empirically testing a comprehensive model by integrating philanthropic actions, WB and FE to predict user loyalty and repeat intention to donate towards online fantasy sports gaming platforms. The findings add depth to our understanding of philanthropic actions linked to fantasy sports gaming platforms and users' loyalty and donation intentions towards such platforms. The results of ANN indicated the normalized importance of the predictors of user loyalty and found that philanthropic action was the strongest predictor. Likewise, philanthropic actions, WB, and FE were necessary conditions (must-have) to determine user loyalty during NCA. The findings would provide invaluable intelligence to fantasy gaming companies to oversee critical philanthropic decisions proficiently. In addition, the results would provide valuable insights to decision-makers in philanthropic foundations and other entities, such as practitioners and online fantasy gaming companies, to devise effective marketing strategies to gauge user loyalty and shape donation intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Suryavanshi A.K.S.; Thomas S.; Trivedi T.; Patel R.; Bhatt V.,Strategic,10.1002/nvsm.1819,and fantasy sports gaming; flow experience; philanthropic actions; repeat intention to donate; user loyalty; well-being,5.0,,10,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study provides insights into user loyalty and donation intentions towards fantasy sports gaming platforms, focusing on long-term implications for marketing strategies and philanthropic actions.

"Business sales forecasting is an example of management decision making in an ill-structured, uncertain problem domain. Due to the dynamic complexities of both internal and external corporate environments, many firms resort to qualitative forecasting techniques. However, these qualitative techniques lack the structure and extrapolation capability of quantitative forecasting models, and forecasting inaccuracies typically lead to dramatic disturbances in production planning. This paper presents the development of a hybrid econometric-neural network model for forecasting total monthly sales. This model attempts to integrate the structural characteristics of econometric models with the non-linear pattern recognition features of neural networks to create a ""hybrid"" modeling approach. A three-stage model is created that attempts to sequentially ""filter"" forecasts where the output from one stage becomes part of the input to the next stage. The forecasts from each of the individual sub-models are then ""averaged"" to compute the hybrid forecast. Model development is discussed in the content of an actual sales forecasting problem from a Danish company that produces consumer goods. Actual model performance is reported for a six-month time period. Knowledge gained from the modeling approach is placed in the context of organizational learning about the nature of sales forecasting for this particular company.",Luxhøj J.T.; Riis J.O.; Stensballe B.,Tactical,10.1016/0925-5273(96)00039-4,Hybrid econometric-neural network; Sales forecasting,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier,"The abstract discusses the development of a forecasting model aimed at improving business sales predictions, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"With the rise in use of social media to promote branded products, the demand for effective influencer marketing has increased. Brands are looking for improved ways to identify valuable influencers among a vast catalogue; this is even more challenging with micro-influencers, which are more affordable than mainstream ones but difficult to discover. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to improve the state of the art in micro-influencer ranking based on multimedia content. Moreover, since the visual congruence between a brand and influencer has been shown to be a good measure of compatibility, we provide an effective visual method for interpreting our model's decisions, which can also be used to inform brands' media strategies. We compare with the current state of the art on a recently constructed public dataset and we show significant improvement both in terms of accuracy and model complexity.

"One of the substantial challenges in marketing efforts is determining optimal markets, specifically in market segmentation. The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets.

"Purpose: Businesses embark on cause-related marketing (CRM) initiatives as a marketing strategy to fortify consumers' behavioural intentions. Prior research indicates that human values could be tapped to understand the consumers' responses to perceived organizational motives behind undertaking social cause initiatives. This research employs Schwartz's theory of human values to examine consumers' patronage intentions towards CRM-linked fashion products. Moreover, fashion leaders play a crucial role in the diffusion of the latest fashion and fashion trends. This research investigates by integrating human values and fashion leadership, offering insights into CRM-linked fashion consumption motives. Design/methodology/approach: The overarching goal was to investigate the complex interplay between human values and female fashion leadership to predict CRM patronage intention (CPI). Hence, a large-scale research study on 2,050 samples was undertaken by adopting threefold partial least squares–multigroup analysis–artificial neural network (PLS-MGA-ANN) to establish and empirically test a comprehensive model. Findings: This study is unique as it establishes and validates the relative or normalized importance placed on human values by fashion leaders, thereby predicting CPIs. The results revealed that women with high-fashion leadership and specific value types (benevolence, universalism, self-direction) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion retailers. In addition, the findings validated that women with low-fashion leadership and specific value types (tradition, security, conformity) are more likely to patronize CRM-linked fashion stores. Originality/value: The findings provide a valuable rationale to non-profit marketers, fashion marketing experts and practitioners to design customer value-based profiling and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Thomas S.; A.K.S S.; Bhatt V.; Malkar V.; Pandey S.; Patel R.,Strategic,10.1108/JFMM-11-2023-0303,Cause-related marketing; CRM patronage intention; Female fashion leadership; Human values; Non-profit marketing,5.0,,5,0,Emerald Publishing,"The research investigates the long-term implications of consumer behavior influenced by human values and fashion leadership in the context of cause-related marketing (CRM).

"Personalized marketing in retail requires a model to predict how different marketing actions affect product choices by individual customers. Large retailers often handle millions of transactions daily, involving thousands of products in hundreds of categories. Product choice models thus need to scale to large product assortments and customer bases, without extensive product attribute information. To address these challenges, we propose a custom deep neural network model. The model incorporates bottleneck layers to encode cross-product relationships, calibrates time-series filters to capture purchase dynamics for products with different interpurchase times, and relies on weight sharing between the products to improve convergence and scale to large assortments. The model applies to loyalty card transaction data without predefined categories or product attributes to predict customer-specific purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions. In a simulation, the proposed product choice model predicts purchase decisions better than baseline methods by adjusting the predicted probabilities for the effects of recent purchases and price discounts. The improved predictions lead to substantially higher revenue gains in a simulated coupon personalization problem. We verify predictive performance using transaction data from a large retailer with experimental variation in price discounts.

"Purpose: The negative influence of gamification on online communities has received little attention in the available literature. The study examines the adverse effects of gamification during engaging in online communities. Design/methodology/approach: Gap-spotting methods were used to develop the research questions, followed by model development using the social exchange and social-network theories. Data were collected from 429 samples. The study applied partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses followed by ANN application. Findings: The study identified five factors related to gamification that have a significant adverse effect on the mental and emotional well-being of the users. Furthermore, the results of PLS-SEM were then compared through an artificial neural network (ANN) analytic process, revealing consistency for the model. This research presents a theoretical contribution by providing critical insights into online gamers' mental and emotional health.

"When deciding in which segment to invest or how to distribute the marketing budget, managers generally take risks in making decisions without considering the real impact every client or segment has over organizational profits. In this paper, a segmentation framework is proposed that considers, firstly, the calculation of customer lifetime value, the current value, and client loyalty, and then the building of client segments by self-organized maps. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with an empirical study in a cane sugar mill where a total of 9 segments of interest were identified for decision making. © 2012 Universidad ICESI.

"Learning outcomes: Upon completion of the case study, the students will be able to analyze the brand equity construct through the associative neural network model for decision-making; identify prospective scenarios through the Delphi method for the construction of strategic plans in organizations; and propose the innovation of a product by applying creativity techniques to enter international markets. Case overview/synopsis: Cafe Galavis was one of the leading family businesses in industrial development and had the highest business recognition, with a century of experience in producing and commercializing roasted and ground coffee in Cucuta, Colombia. In 2015, the diplomatic crisis between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela led to the indefinite closure of the Colombian–Venezuelan border, which caused an increase in income from smuggled coffee. In addition, the presence of different competitors and traditional brands negatively impacted the level of sales, which considerably affected financial stability. Likewise, internal difficulties of family nature and administrative management led to the change of senior management. By 2016, Juan Yáñez was appointed chief executive officer (CEO) and was in charge of avoiding the company’s closure. In January 2023, he received feedback from his consulting team, and upon evaluation of the new market challenges with his collaborators, he realized a great challenge that merited the search for a priority alternative solution. How to design a new product considering the loss of brand identity in the face of the generational change of its consumers? These were some of the challenges posed by the CEO that consequently required starting a strategic management process of innovation. Complexity academic level: The teaching case is aimed at students of postgraduate academic programs in the areas of knowledge of innovation, product design, industrial design, marketing or MBA. In the modules of marketing, strategic management, brand management and strategic foresight, the case allowed for the orientation of the concepts of brand value or branding as well as the analysis of the value chain for the implementation of strategies that promote competitive advantages of companies.

"The multinomial probit model introduced here combines heterogeneity across households with flexibility of the (deterministic) utility function. To achieve flexibility deterministic utility is approximated by a neural net of the multilayer perceptron type. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method serves to estimate heterogeneous multinomial probit models which fulfill economic restrictions on signs of (marginal) effects of predictors (e.g., negative for price). For empirical choice data the heterogeneous multinomial probit model extended by a multilayer perceptron clearly outperforms all the other models studied. Moreover, replacing homogeneous by heterogeneous reference price mechanisms and thus allowing price expectations to be formed differently across households also leads to better model performance. Mean utility differences and mean elasticities w.r.t. price and price deviation from reference price demonstrate that models with linear utility and nonlinear utility approximated by a multilayer perceptron lead to very different implications for managerial decision making.

"This study aims to incorporate Artificial Neural Networks into a Marketing Decision Support System (MDSS), specifically, by discovering important variables that influence sales performance of colour television (CTV) sets in the Singapore market using neural networks. Three kinds of variables, expert knowledge, marketing information and environmental data, are examined. The information about the effects of each of these variables has been studied and made available for decision making. However, their combined effect is unknown. This study attempts to explore the combined effect for the benefit of our collaborator, a multinational corporation (MNC) in the consumer electronics industry in Singapore. Putting these three variables together as input variables results in a neural network model. Neural network training is conducted using historical data on CTV sales in Singapore collected over the past one and a half years. Sensitivity analysis is then performed to reduce input variables of neural networks. This is done by analyzing the weights of the input node connections in the trained neural networks using two different methods. The weaker variables can be excluded, and this results in a simpler model. Further, an R-Square value of almost 1 is obtained through the inclusion of an Unknown variable when the network model consisting only of the most influential variables is trained and tested. Knowing the most influential variables, which in this case include Average Price, Screen Size, Stereo Systems, Flat-Square screen type and Seasonal Factors, marketing managers can improve sales performance by paying more attention to them.",Yao J.; Teng N.; Poh H.-L.; Tan C.L.,Tactical,,Artificial neural networks; Marketing decision support systems; Marketing mix; Sales forecasting; Variable reduction,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks to improve marketing decisions related to sales performance.

"Mall managers tend to believe that purchasing decisions are made inside the shopping malls. These decisions, however, are influenced by various antecedent factors. This implies that shoppers look beyond the basic chore of shopping and experience while shopping plays a vital role. To attract the attention of shoppers, mall developers make huge investments in mall promotion and ambient factors in order to enhance the shopping experience. As the Indian shoppers’ euphoria about shopping malls gets toned down with time, mall managers need to focus on something more substantive. Such fundamental benefits can be offered to shoppers only if mall managers know what is more relevant for the shoppers visiting the malls. Past studies have identified a number of factors such as ambience, physical infrastructure, convenience, safety, and marketing activities. This research posits that a more optimal and focused approach in mall management requires identification of relative significance of various influencing factors. This way, mall managers would be able to offer the most meaningful benefits to shoppers at a very optimal level of investment. Once shoppers get what they value the most, they are expected to be more loyal to the shopping mall. Despite the development of various forecasting techniques, predicting mall loyalty has remained under-explored in marketing literature. This article addresses the gap by using neural network model to predict shoppers’ loyalty towards a particular mall. To gain more insights from the model, the authors have also identified relative significance of the factors impacting shoppers’ mall selection. This study establishes that mall shoppers value ‘convenience’ as the most influencing factor in their selection of malls. This factor alone garners one-third of the total weightage among the five factors, which reflects that significance of convenience is 66 per cent more than what is expected in a scenario when all determinants contribute equally. This strongly indicates that Indian mall shoppers are more utilitarian than hedonic. © 2017, © 2017 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.",Prashar S.; Singh H.; Parsad C.; Vijay T.S.,Strategic,10.1177/0256090917731431,Malls selection; Neural network; Predictive analysis; Retailing; Shopping environment; Shopping experience; Shopping mall,5.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract focuses on long-term strategies for mall management, emphasizing the importance of understanding shopper preferences and loyalty as critical factors in the overall success of shopping malls.

"Purpose: This research aims to determine the ideal fare for various aircraft itineraries by modeling prices using a neural network method. Dynamic pricing has been studied from the airline’s point of view, with a focus on demand forecasting and price differentiation. Early demand forecasting on a specific route can assist an airline in strategically planning flights and determining optimal pricing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A feedforward neural network was employed in the current study. Two hidden layers, consisting of 18 and 12 neurons, were incorporated to enhance the network’s capabilities. The activation function employed for these layers was tanh. Additionally, it was considered that the output layer’s functions were linear. The neural network inputs considered in this study were flight path, month of flight, flight date (week/day), flight time, aircraft type (Boeing, Airbus, other), and flight class (economy, business). The neural network output, on the other hand, was the ticket price. The dataset comprises 16,585 records, specifically flight data for Iranian airlines for 2022. Findings: The findings indicate that the model achieved a high level of accuracy in approximating the actual data. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to predict the optimal ticket price for various flight routes with minimal error. Practical implications: Based on the significant alignment observed between the actual data and the tested data utilizing the algorithmic model, airlines can proactively anticipate ticket prices across all routes, optimizing the revenue generated by each flight. The neural network algorithm utilized in this study offers a valuable opportunity for companies to enhance their decision-making processes. By leveraging the algorithm’s features, companies can analyze past data effectively and predict future prices. This enables them to make informed and timely decisions based on reliable information.

"The direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are emerging to reach more number of consumers with more potential to meet their expectations. They are characterized through their metamorphosis as the vertical brands sell their products from the manufacturer to consumers directly without any interruptions from distribution channels as in traditional mode of doing business. They are annihilating themselves in the virtual platforms and later disrupting their existing linear sales models. This empirical investigation is targeted to construct an algorithmic model through a deep learning process which has been instrumental to predict the purchase decision. This investigation has churned a predictive model that is based on the attributes of the buying behaviour of the consumers. The attributes of online buying behaviour like safety of transaction, availability of innovative products and quality of products have been considered to build a predictive model through artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy of training and testing data are closer, which infers about the consistency and validity of the predictive model.

"Tourism shopping via mobile applications has revolutionized the tourism industry. The research examined the antecedents to the adoption of mobile tourism shopping (MTS) via an integrated model, consisting of the Mobile Technology Acceptance Model, consumer perception of merchant ethics, consumer decision-making styles, and characteristics of mobile applications. The results were empirically validated via the PLS-SEM-ANN method. The findings indicated that mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use, application quality, and service quality have significant positive correlations with the intention to use MTS, whereas privacy concern has displayed a significant negative relationship. Moreover, source reliability, application reputation, perfectionism, and novelty-fashion consciousness were revealed to be statistically insignificant to the development of adoption intention toward MTS. Furthermore, the ANN results have indicated the existence of a non-linear hidden attribute in the prediction of ANN Model A. The research has generated valuable theoretical implications and practical insights. For one, the advantages that come with the adoption of MTS and the security measures taken by the service providers should be highlighted to the prospects via effective marketing messages to nurture confidence, which can subsequently drive adoption. © 2021 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",Wan S.-M.; Cham L.-N.; Tan G.W.-H.; Lo P.-S.; Ooi K.-B.; Chatterjee R.-S.,Tactical,10.1080/08874417.2021.2004564,artificial neural network analysis; consumer decision-making; Mobile commerce; privacy concern; tourism,5.0,,15,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The research focuses on the factors influencing the adoption of mobile tourism shopping, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and user engagement tactics.

"This paper presents one of the possibilities of the decision theory that can be used in the modelling of the quality of life in a given city in the Czech Republic. Real data sets of citizen questioners for the city of Chrudim were analysed, pre-processed, and used in the model. This model is defined as classification model and it uses algorithms used in decision trees. A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regression models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appropriately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute's value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique. There are various top-down decision trees inducers such as ID3, C4.5, and C&RT. In our case we used C5.0, C&RT, and CHAID algorithm for the modelling of the quality of life in the previously mentioned city. Similar results were achieved through out our research when using the mentioned algorithms. However, the best results were achieved when using the C5.0 algorithm.

This relationship has been the focus of attention of other scholars, but much remains to be done in terms of providing a better understanding of it. To help fill this gap, we analyze the impact of marketing decisions on delivery performance. More specifically, we seek to know how sales, sellers, promotion and other variables that characterize marketing decisions impact delivery performance. We collected data about marketing decisions and delivery performance for a period of 30 months in a large manufacturing company in Brazil.

"The potential of neural networks for classification problems has been established by numerous successful applications reported in the literature. One of the major assumptions used in almost all studies is the equal cost consequence of misclassification. With this assumption, minimizing the total number of misclassification errors is the sole objective in developing a neural network classifier. Often this is done simply to ease model development and the selection of classification decision points. However, it is not appropriate for many real situations such as quality assurance, direct marketing, bankruptcy prediction, and medical diagnosis where misclassification costs have unequal consequences for different categories. In this paper, we investigate the issue of unequal misclassification costs in neural network classifiers. Through an application in thyroid disease diagnosis, we find that different cost considerations have significant effects on the classification performance and that appropriate use of cost information can aid in optimal decision making. A cross-validation technique is employed to alleviate the problem of bias in the training set and to examine the robustness of neural network classifiers with regard to sampling variations and cost differences.",Berardi V.L.; Zhang G.P.,Out of scope,10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb00902.x,Classification; Medical diagnosis; Misclassification Costs; Neural Networks; Statistical Techniques,0.0,,0,100,Decision Sciences Institute,"The abstract discusses the application of neural networks to classification problems in medical diagnosis, specifically thyroid disease, which is outside the realm of marketing.",scopus-neural network,0,0,The effect of misclassification costs on neural network classifiers,1999

"This paper investigates the potentialities of the new technology based on neural networks to realize a DSS that might help the marketing and product planning management of a factory in conceiving strategic decisions regarding prices and product performance levels in an oligopolistic market. A possible oligopolistic market scenario assumes a multiplicity of customers whose choices on a given product set have to be explained; the individual choices of these subjects contribute to defining some market shares to be estimated—with their possible evolution—by a multicriteria model (management’s problem formulation). Very few computer based systems to support such a complex problem are found in literature; developed essentially with “classic” methodologies and techniques, they suffer from considering either one single decisional subject (the market/consumer) or a multiplicity of monocriterion choices under uncertainty conditions, without taking into account any integrated representation wich might permit a multiactorial interpretation of “the market” to be given. An approach based on neural networks seems to allow such limits to be overcome, as it has been applied successfully to design and develop a prototype of DSS (MUTANT) for the problem formulated. Some first computational experiments allow some positive judgements to be expressed about the system’s validity and the promising potentialities of a new “modelling and problem solving” approach that might be usefully applied so as to enlarge some potentialities of other multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) methods. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Boscarino M.; Gianoglio P.; Ostanello A.,Strategic,10.1080/12460125.1993.10511571,Explicative models; Multicriteria decisions; Multiple choices; Neural networks,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract discusses the development of a decision support system (DSS) based on neural networks to assist in strategic decision-making related to pricing and product performance in an oligopolistic market, which aligns with long-term goals and market strategy.",scopus-neural network,70,20,A Neural Network Design to Support Decision Making with a Complex Multicriteria Problem,1993
"Until now, neuromarketing studies have usually been aimed at assessing the predictive value of psychophysiological measures gathered while watching a marketing message related to a particular product. This study is the first attempt to verify the possibility of predicting familiar and unfamiliar brand purchases based on psychophysiological reactions to a retailer television advertisement measured by EEG, EDA and eye-tracking. The number of private label products chosen later served to assess the binary dependent variable. A logistic regression model (with a prediction rate of 61.2%) was applied to determine which psychophysiological variables explained the largest part of the variance of a final purchase decision. The results show that among various measures, only the electrodermal peaks per second were significant in predicting further purchase decisions. The decision to buy was also influenced by brand familiarity.

"Store branded lookalike packaging resembling national brand product (NB) packaging creates confusion for consumers who are uncertain about their quality preference of the store brand product (SB). This paper presents a model for exploring the NB manufacturer's wholesale price decision, and the response of the SB retailer, considering consumer confusion. Consumers differ in their quality preferences for products and are classified into two groups: deliberate and confused, depending on whether they have precise quality preferences of the SB. We find that when facing a hybrid structure of consumers, the retailer will introduce the SB only when the quality preference difference between high- and low-end consumers is moderate. When the SB is offered, the retailer may not always benefit from targeting low-end consumers with the SB only; a mixed strategy by attracting low-end (high-end) consumers to the national (store) brand product can bring higher profit. Examining the effect of consumer confusion, we find that it may bring a win-win, lose-lose, or win-lose situation for the manufacturer and retailer, depending on the quality preference difference and proportion of high-end consumers. We then consider the case when being deliberate is a choice of the consumer, finding that the retailer will induce consumers to be deliberate only when the store brand quality is low. Consumer confusion will always create a win-win outcome for the manufacturer and retailer when (1) SB quality is higher than NB quality, (2) SB quality is endogenized, or (3) consumers are confused about their quality preference for both the NB and SB. The consumer surplus may be enhanced or weakened, depending on the retailer's market segmentation strategy. Our results reconcile some discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical findings regarding the impacts of consumer confusion about the SB derived from lookalike packaging on a two-echelon supply chain, and our insights are robust. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Zha Y.; Guo X.; Chen H.; Ling L.,Strategic,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102841,Competition; Consumer confusion; Store brand; Store branded lookalike packaging; Supply chain management,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses long-term implications of consumer confusion and pricing strategies for national and store brands, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,60,25,How does Store Branded Lookalike Packaging Affect Competition in a Dyadic Supply Chain: A Consumer Confusion Perspective,2022
"Games as a service is similar to software as a service, which provides players with game content on a continuous monetization model. Game revenue forecast is vital to game developers to make the right business decisions, such as determining the marketing budget, controlling the development cost, and setting up benchmarks for evaluating game publishing performance. How to make the revenue forecast and integrate it with the game publishing process is hard for small and medium-sized independent (indie) game developers. This includes all steps of the process, from forecasting to decision-making based on the results. This paper provides a data-driven method that uses the mobile game revenue forecast based on different time-series prediction models to drive the game publishing. We demonstrate how to use the data-driven method to guide an indie game studio to forecast revenue and then set the revenue forecast as the internal benchmark to drive game publishing. In practice, we involve a real game project from an indie game studio and provide guidance for one of their casual game projects. Then, based on the revenue forecast, we discuss how to set the revenue forecast as an internal benchmark and drive the actions for mobile game publishing. Finally, we make a conclusion on how our data-driven method can be used to drive mobile game publishing and also discuss future research work. © 2021, The Author(s).",Su Y.; Backlund P.; Engström H.,Tactical,10.1007/s11761-021-00332-2,Benchmark; Business Intelligence; Game analytics; Game metrics; Game publishing; Indie game developer; Time-series prediction,5.0,,15,0,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,The abstract discusses a data-driven method for forecasting mobile game revenue and how this forecast can be used as an internal benchmark to drive game publishing decisions.

"Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) are highly perishable fruit. Timely prediction of yield is crucial for labor management and marketing decision-making. This study demonstrates the use of high-resolution ground-based imagery, in addition to previous yield and weather information, for yield prediction throughout the season at different intervals (3-4 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks preharvest). Flower and fruit counts, yield, and high-resolution imagery data were collected 31 times for two cultivars (‘Florida Radiance’ and ‘Florida Beauty’) throughout the growing season. Orthorectified mosaics and digital surface models were created to extract canopy size variables (canopy area, average canopy height, canopy height standard deviation, and canopy volume) and visually count flower and fruit number. Data collected at the plot level (6 plots per cultivar, 24 plants per plot) were used to develop prediction models. Using image-based counts and canopy variables, flower and fruit counts were predicted with percentage prediction errors of 26.3% and 25.7%, respectively. Furthermore, by adding image-derived variables to the models, the accuracy of predicting out-of-sample yields at different time intervals was increased by 10-29% compared to those models without image-derived variables. These results suggest that close-range high-resolution images can contribute to yield prediction and could assist the industry with decision making by changing growers’ prediction practices. © 2021 by the authors.",Abd-Elrahman A.; Wu F.; Agehara S.; Britt K.,Tactical,10.3390/ijgi10040239,Canopy size metrics; Fragaria x ananassa; High-resolution; Image analysis; Regression model,5.0,,15,0,MDPI AG,"The study emphasizes the practical application of high-resolution imagery for yield prediction in strawberry cultivation, which aligns with structured decision-making processes.

"The market basket data in the form of a binary user–item matrix or a binary item–user matrix can be modeled as a binary classification problem, which actually tackles collaborative filtering (CF) as well as target marketing. Effective variable selection (VS) can increase the prediction accuracy as well as identify important users or items in CF as well as target marketing. Therefore, we propose two new VS approaches: a Pearson correlation-based approach and a forward random forests regression-based approach, comparing the performance in a variety of experimental settings. The experimental results show that the proposed VS approaches outperform the conventional approaches in the examples. Furthermore, the experimental results are more reasonable and informative than the previous experimental results because the binary misclassification error and Top-N accuracy for the user CF, the item CF, the user modeling, and the item modeling are all considered in this paper. © 2018 The Authors.

"There is a growing need in the marketing field to understand how consumers can be persuaded to consume healthier products. This research makes novel predictions about the time-of-day effects on (un)healthy product purchases based on self-control theory. We investigated whether and how time of day (morning vs. evening) influences consumers’ (un)healthy product purchases. A field study based on point-of-sales data indicated that consumers tend to buy more unhealthy products in the evening. Two laboratory experiments confirmed that this is due to a decrease in self-control in the evening, which leads consumers to purchase more unhealthy products at this time. A follow-up eye-tracking experiment further revealed potential mechanisms whereby lower self-control causes consumers to focus more on unhealthy products and weakens the effect of attention to healthy products on purchases. The findings provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and marketing decisions for marketing academics, retailers and consumer marketing companies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Yang S.; Wang Y.; Li Z.; Chen C.; Yu Z.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.07.058,Eye-tracking; Purchase decision; Self-control; Synchrony effect; User-generated behavior,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The research provides insights into consumer behavior related to the purchase of healthy and unhealthy products, which can be applied to marketing tactics such as campaign strategies and targeting.

"Purpose: This research article aims to understand the role of brand image, service quality and price (charge) in revitalising functional mass brands into prestigious mass brands. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical research framework was developed by synthesising the past literature on masstige marketing and brand extension. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire from 396 respondents availing M-Wallet. Structural equation modelling was used to validate the brand revitalization attributes; further, the binary logistic regression model examined the effect of revitalization attributes on the chance of increasing customer's perception of masstige. Findings: The exploratory study suggested brand image, service quality and value for money pricing as essential attributes to revitalize mass brands into masstige brands; furthermore, path analysis validated the positive effects of these attributes on the perception of masstige. The proposed binary logistic regression model suggested brand image as sensitive attributes, increasing the odds ratio by 9.39 times in favour of perceiving brand as masstige followed by the perceived service quality that is 5.87 times. The prediction capability of the proposed binary logistic regression model is found to be 96%. Practical implications: The methodology of this study provides the basis for future researchers to advance research on masstige. This study will assist the marketers of mass brands to make better marketing decisions related to how masstige image can be sustained or a new or less known brand can be revitalized into a prestigious brand. Originality/value: This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of how the mass brand can be revitalised as masstige brands by considering image, quality and price attributes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Singh B.,Strategic,10.1108/APJML-08-2021-0628,Brand revitalization; Image; Logistic regression; Masstige; Mobile payment system; Price; Service quality; Up-scale line extension,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The abstract discusses the revitalization of mass brands into masstige brands through brand image, service quality, and pricing strategies, which are long-term strategic marketing decisions.",scopus-prediction,60,25,"Understanding the role of image, quality and price for developing prestigious mass brands",2023

"Purpose: The rise of social media has led to the emergence of influencers and influencer marketing (IM) domains, which have become important areas of academic inquiry. However, despite its prominence as an area for study, several significant challenges must be addressed. One significant challenge involves identifying, assessing and recommending social media influencers (SMIs). This study proposes a semantic network model capable of measuring an influencer's performance on specific topics or subjects to address this issue. This study can assist managers in identifying suitable SMIs based on their estimated reach. Design/methodology/approach: Data from popular YouTube influencers and publicly available performance measures (views and likes) are extracted. Second, the titles of the past videos made by the influencer are used to develop a semantic network connecting all the videos to other videos based on similarity measures. Third, the nearest neighbor approach extracts the neighbors of the target title video. Finally, based on the set of neighbors, a range prediction is made for the views and likes of the target video with the influencer. Findings: The results show that the model can predict an accurate range of views and likes based on the suggested video titles and the content creator, with 69–78% accuracy across different influencers on YouTube. Research limitations/implications: The current study introduces a novel and innovative approach that exploits the textual association between a SMI's previous content to forecast the outcome of their future content. Although the findings are encouraging, this research recognizes various constraints that upcoming researchers may tackle. Forecasting views of posts concerning novel subjects and precisely adjusting video view counts based on their age constitute two primary limitations of this study. Practical implications: Managers interested in hiring influencers can employ the suggested approach to evaluate an influencer's potential performance on a specific topic. This research aids managers in making informed decisions regarding influencer selection, utilizing data-based metrics that are simple to comprehend and explain.

"We consider user retention analytics for online freemium role-playing games (RPGs). RPGs constitute a very popular genre of computer-based games that, along with a player's gaming actions, focus on the development of the player's in-game virtual character through a persistent exploration of the gaming environment. Most RPGs follow the freemium business model in which the gamers can play for free but they are charged for premium add-on amenities. As with other freemium products, RPGs suffer from the curse of high dropout rates. This makes retention analysis extremely important for successful operation and survival of their gaming portals. Here, we develop a disciplined statistical framework for retention analysis by modelling multiple in-game player characteristics along with the dropout probabilities. We capture players’ motivations through engagement times, collaboration and achievement score at each level of the game, and jointly model them using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm) framework that further includes a time-to-event variable corresponding to churn. We capture the interdependencies in a player's level-wise engagement, collaboration, achievement with dropout through a shared parameter model. We illustrate interesting changes in player behaviours as the gaming level progresses. The parameters in our joint model were estimated by a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporated a divide-and-recombine approach for increased scalability in glmm estimation that was needed to accommodate our large longitudinal gaming data-set. By incorporating the level-wise changes in a player's motivations and using them for dropout rate prediction, our method greatly improves on state-of-the-art retention models. Based on data from a popular action based RPG, we demonstrate the competitive optimality of our proposed joint modelling approach by exhibiting its improved predictive performance over competitors. In particular, we outperform aggregate statistics based methods that ignore level-wise progressions as well as progression tracking non-joint model such as the Cox proportional hazards model. We also display improved predictions of popular marketing retention statistics and discuss how they can be used in managerial decision making. © 2021 Royal Statistical Society",Karmakar B.; Liu P.; Mukherjee G.; Che H.; Dutta S.,Tactical,10.1111/rssa.12730,,5.0,,15,0,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The abstract focuses on user retention analytics for online freemium RPGs, which involves structured decision-making to improve player retention and engagement.

"The purpose of this study was to expand existing knowledge of hotel consumers’ green behaviors by merging value-belief-norm theory and the theory of planned behavior into one theoretical framework to understand comprehensively consumers’ decision-making processes with respect to their intentions to visit a green hotel. Data collected from 757 respondents were analyzed. The results indicate that our integrated framework demonstrates a favorable level of prediction power for guests’ behavior, which verified the superiority of the suggested framework. Furthermore, its findings from fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis indicate that: (a) attitude toward green hotels, perceived behavioral control, sense of obligation, and corporate image are key drivers of guests’ intentions to visit green hotels; (b) three distinct configurations of guests’ intention drivers are likely to result in a high degree of intentions among customers to visit green hotels. The three solutions all contain the conditions of high attitude, corporate image, biospheric value, and green activities, which means that these conditions are vital components of a high intention among customers to visit green hotels. This study contributes to the growing literature on sustainability in marketing and practice by providing useful insights about the determinants of guests’ behavior to use green hotels in the Egyptian hospitality context.

"Online games make up the largest segment of the booming global game market in terms of revenue as well as players. Unlike games that sell games at one time for profit, online games make money from in-game purchases by a large number of engaged players. Therefore, Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is particularly vital for game companies to improve marketing decisions and increase game revenues. Nowadays, as virtual game worlds are becoming increasingly innovative, complex, and diverse, the CLTV of massive players is highly personalized. That is, different players may have very different patterns of CLTV, especially on churn and payment. However, current solutions are inadequate in terms of personalization and thus limit predictive performance. First, most methods just attempt to address either task of CLTV, i.e., churn or payment, and only consider the personalization from one of them. Second, the correlation between churn and payment has not received enough attention and its personalization has not been fully explored yet. Last, most solutions around this line are conducted based on historical data where the evaluation is not convincing enough without real-world tests. To tackle these problems, we propose a general system to predict personalized customer lifetime value in online games, named perCLTV. To be specific, we revisit the personalized CLTV prediction problem from the two sub-Tasks of churn prediction and payment prediction in a sequential gated multi-Task learning fashion. On this basis, we develop a generalized framework to model CLTV across games in distinct genres by heterogeneous player behavior data, including individual behavior sequential data and social behavior graph data. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and rationality of perCLTV, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Our work has been implemented and deployed in many online games released from NetEase Games. Online A/B testing in production shows that perCLTV achieves a prominent improvement in two precision marketing applications of popup recommendation and churn intervention. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Zhao S.; Wu R.; Tao J.; Qu M.; Zhao M.; Fan C.; Zhao H.,Tactical,10.1145/3530012,churn prediction; multi-Task learning; online games; payment prediction; Personalized customer lifetime value,5.0,,10,0,Association for Computing Machinery,"The abstract discusses a specific system for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) in online games, which involves targeted applications like churn intervention and personalized marketing strategies.

"Virtual reality can influence consumer behavior in powerful ways, but in the domain of tourism marketing, less is known about the psychological process. One possibility is that VR has stronger impact on mental imagery than traditional channels, creating vivid simulations of what it would be like to visit destinations. This process might create hedonic expectations of future happiness, which should increase the willingness to actually seek out the destination in real life. The results from a laboratory experiment provided support to this hypothesis. Participants were randomly assigned to view a nature destination either in traditional still images or virtual reality, and then reported their initial responses before making an actual consumer choice. VR exposure led to higher levels of mental imagery and happiness predictions, which in turn was associated with stronger travel intentions and purchasing decisions. However, VR effects on consumer choice were moderated by previous experience with the destination. © 2021 The Authors",Skard S.; Knudsen E.S.; Sjåstad H.; Thorbjørnsen H.,Tactical,10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104360,Affective forecasting; Behavioral intentions; Mental imagery; Purchase; Telepresence; Virtual reality,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses how virtual reality impacts consumer behavior in tourism marketing, particularly focusing on decision-making processes related to travel intentions and purchasing decisions.

"This article focuses on the critical importance of demand estimates for effective planning and decision-making in the railway freight transportation industry. Various departments within transportation companies, including marketing, production, distribution, and finance departments, heavily rely on accurate demand forecasts to make informed decisions. Forecasting demand is a crucial aspect of managing business processes, and the methods for doing this can vary across different industries. The ultimate goal remains consistent—to obtain precise predictions of future demand by analyzing historical data and current environmental factors. In the context of transportation services, accurate demand forecasting is essential for successful operational planning and management of functional areas such as transportation operations, marketing, and finance. The current case study specifically examines the National Company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ), a transport and logistics holding engaged in rail transportation in Kazakhstan. KTZ’s main sources of income are related to freight transportation. The volume of cargo transportation (in tons) and the freight turnover play a significant role in assessing demand and forecasting future revenues from freight traffic. Different techniques for demand forecasting are explored, including qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods rely on judgments and opinions, while quantitative methods utilize historical data or identify causal relationships between variables. Overall, the present study highlights the critical role of demand forecasting in the railway freight transportation industry and its impact on efficient planning and decision-making processes. © 2023 Silesian University of Technology.

"Trajectories of attention capture the accumulation of brand utility during complex decision-making tasks. Thus, attention trajectories, as reflected in eye movements, predict the final brand choice of 85% of consumers before they implement it. Even when observing eye movements in only the first quarter of the decision process, attention already predicts brand choice much better (45%) than chance levels (20%). This superior prediction performance is due to a “double attention lift” for the chosen brand: The chosen brand receives progressively more attention toward the moment of choice, and more of this attention is devoted to integrating information about the brand rather than to comparing it with other options. In contrast, the currently owned brand grabs attention early in the task, and its attention gain persists for brand-loyal consumers and shifts for brand-switching consumers. A new attention and choice model used in tandem with the Bayesian K-fold cross-validation methodology on eye-tracking data from 325 representative consumers uncovered these attention trajectory effects. The findings contribute to closing important knowledge gaps in the attention and choice literature and have implications for marketing research and managerial practice. © The Author(s) 2023.",Martinovici A.; Pieters R.; Erdem T.,Tactical,10.1177/00222437221141052,attention and brand choice; Bayesian estimation; eye movements; K-fold cross-validation; prediction; utility accumulation,5.0,,15,0,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract discusses attention trajectories and their predictive power regarding brand choice, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing where strategies are shaped into specific actions like targeting and consumer engagement.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Attention Trajectories Capture Utility Accumulation and Predict Brand Choice,2023
"We are all saints and sinners: Some of our actions benefit others, while other actions lead to harm. How do people balance moral rights against moral wrongs when evaluating others' actions? Across 9 studies, we contrast the predictions of three conceptions of intuitive morality—outcome-based (utilitarian), act-based (deontologist), and person-based (virtue ethics) approaches. These experiments establish four principles: Partial offsetting (good acts can partly offset bad acts), diminishing sensitivity (the extent of the good act has minimal impact on its offsetting power), temporal asymmetry (good acts are more praiseworthy when they come after harms), and act congruency (good acts are more praiseworthy to the extent they offset a similar harm). These principles are difficult to square with utilitarian or deontological approaches, but sit well within person-based approaches to moral psychology. Inferences about personal character mediated many of these effects (Studies 1–4), explained differences across items and across individuals (Studies 5–6), and could be manipulated to produce downstream consequences on blame (Studies 7–9); however, there was some evidence for more modest roles of utilitarian and deontological processing too. These findings contribute to conversations about moral psychology and person perception, and may have policy and marketing implications. © 2020",Johnson S.G.B.; Ahn J.,Not identified,10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104467,Intuitive ethics; Moral judgment; Person perception; Reputation; Social cognition,30.0,,10,40,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses moral psychology and person perception without clear ties to marketing strategies, tactics, or operational decisions, making it difficult to classify under the provided categories.",scopus-prediction,10,10,Principles of moral accounting: How our intuitive moral sense balances rights and wrongs,2021

"Objective: This study analyzes, through a systematic literature review, the main approaches used in research on consumer behavior that used eye-tracking as an identifier of physiological reactions. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies published in the last five years, between 2019 and 2023, in nine research databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Emerald, Wiley Online, Sage, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar). Thus, 243 studies were included in the review. Results: The analyzed studies are mainly classified into four different themes of neuromarketing application: purchase decision, behavioral prediction, advertising effects, and customer retention. The main segments analyzed were e-commerce and retail. The predominance of quantitative studies and the need to control sociodemographic variables in the models is highlighted. In summary, there is a suggested need for more multimethod approaches that combine eye-tracking with quantitative and qualitative methods (retrospective interviews), as well as integrate it with other techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), facial biometrics, among others. Theoretical/Methodological Contributions: This research advances the understanding of the state of the art on eye-tracking and its application in neuromarketing, providing insights into methodological pathways. Originality/Relevance: Therefore, the main applications and emerging themes that can be explored in future studies are discussed.

"The accurate prediction of future retail sales is crucial in business. Marketing persistence modeling is a well-established framework for the analysis of retail sales dynamics using a time series approach. However, dominant academic approaches to persistence modeling are rather complex, requiring sophisticated analytic and computing skills. We introduce a decision making approach that allows jointly testing and predicting the evolution of retail sales using a state-space model. We first propose a model, which incorporates the foundations of persistence modeling, and provide a simple estimation method. Secondly, we show a formal procedure for detecting persistence and, hence, selecting parameters to predict future data. An empirical investigation carried out over nearly 30000 Walmart retail sales, shows that our model provides significantly better prediction performance when compared to standard benchmarks.

"Evidence from psychology and marketing suggests that those who make a “precise” first offer in bargaining get a better deal than those who make a “round” first offer. We report on a series of experiments designed to test for and improve our understanding of the “precise first offer” (PFO) effect in bargaining and whether it likely reflects rational optimizing or equilibrium behavior. Our experiment varies whether decisions are incentivized and whether the PFO effect can emerge as an equilibrium of a cheap-talk signaling game. We find evidence of a PFO effect when subjects read a vignette and make unincentivized individual decisions. When monetary incentives are added to the vignette, we still find the PFO effect, but it is not robust. In a bilateral bargaining situation with a cheap-talk equilibrium, we can not find the PFO effect, which is inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions. Moreover, the PFO effect reemerges in a setting in which initial offers are generated by a random device and thus provides a strong refutation of the signaling model. Our evidence suggests that optimizing and equilibrium accounts of the PFO effect are inadequate. Understanding initial offers as reference points, which subtly change perceptions about the kinds of acceptable counteroffers, provides a plausible account of a new finding on which prior explanations are silent: precise offers induce more precise counteroffers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Kimbrough E.O.; Porter D.; Schneider M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.joep.2021.102406,Bargaining; Precise first offers; Reference points,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses the precise first offer (PFO) effect in bargaining, which relates to decision-making processes that influence outcomes in negotiations and marketing contexts.

"Customer lifetime value (CLV) modeling underpins modern marketing analytics, enabling the development of tailored customer relationship management strategies based on the predicted future value of their customers. As part of Amperity’s enterprise customer data platform (CDP), we deploy and maintain a CLV prediction system that caters to a rapidly growing list of brands across various industries, purchase behaviors, and scales. Given the impracticality of developing bespoke models for each brand, our solution must be adaptive, generalizable, and high-performing ”out of the box”. Furthermore, our platform demands daily prediction updates to facilitate prompt marketing decisions. This paper introduces a turnkey CLV prediction system that achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of brands. This system has several contributions: 1) the use of encodings and embeddings to incorporate signals from high-cardinality data; 2) a multi-stage churn-CLV modeling framework that augments additional flexibility in adjusting churn probabilities, subsequently reducing CLV prediction errors while maintaining a synergistic learning process; 3) a feature-weighted ensemble of both generative and discriminative models to accommodate diverse underlying purchase patterns. Empirical results show that our enhanced model consistently surpasses benchmark performances for twelve retail brands across six evaluation intervals from June 2020 to September 2022. © The Author(s) 2023. corrected publication 2023.",Yan Y.; Resnick N.,Tactical,10.1007/s11129-023-09272-x,Churn prediction; Customer data platform; Customer lifetime value; Ensemble modeling; M31; Marketing analytics,5.0,,15,0,Springer,"The abstract details a CLV prediction system that provides actionable insights for marketing decisions and customer relationship management.

"Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between organizational capacity, slack resource, platform strategic choice and firm performance. It also tackles the endogenous issues regarding the strategic choice of platform types. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Heckman’s two-stage procedures to examine the relationship between the variables. The sample in this study comes from Compustat annual company and segment files. The sample used in the main analysis consists of 252 individual corporations globally and 3,528 firm-year observations from 2004–2017. Findings: The empirical results suggest that: (1) firms are more likely to develop physical platforms than virtual platforms when they possess higher levels of available slack, potential slack, research and development (R&D) capacity and marketing capacity; (2) in general, firms developing physical platforms perform better than firms developing virtual platforms after the endogeneity bias are controlled; and (3) firms that choose to develop physical platforms perform better than if they had chosen to develop virtual platforms. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the platform research literature by proposing the endogenous role of platform type choice in firm performance in the context of the retail industry. Prior conceptual and theoretical platform studies have seldom focused on the retail industry through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. This study also presents many opportunities for further explorations on the relationship between firm strategic choice and firm performance in the context of platform retail industry. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that firms must realize that their performance is not necessarily affected by these platform type choice determinants in terms of potential slack, available slack, R&D capacity and marketing capacity. By contrast, they should pay more attention to developing physical platforms if it is possible. The study findings indicate that although virtual platforms have grown rapidly because of the development of technology, firm performance is at all times superior when firms choose to develop physical platforms. Originality/value: Prior platform studies have focused on the topic of network structure, platform architecture, pricing strategy, platform leadership and platform design and governance within the context of video game industry, software industry, hardware industry and telecommunications industry. Seldom of them focus on other industries through a strategic choice perspective. Furthermore, one of the contributions of this study is the derivation of empirical support for the research’s prediction using data from actual firms carried out by global physical and virtual platform companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Lee H.; Hsiao Y.-C.; Chen C.-J.; Guo R.-S.,Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-07-2019-0341,Business strategy; Electronic commerce; Organizational capacity; Physical platform; Retail industry; Slack resource; Strategic management; Virtual platform,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the relationship between organizational capacity, platform strategic choice, and firm performance, which aligns with long-term planning and defining organizational goals.

"Purpose: Heightened public concerns for the global environment due to human overexploitation have given rise to many green product initiatives by businesses. Green cosmetics (GC) are products developed and marketed based on ecological sustainability and have shown increasing consumer appeal worldwide. The current research investigates the antecedents of green cosmetics consumption among Indian GC users, hitherto un-investigated comprehensively. Design/methodology/approach: The study is a cross-sectional pairwise comparison of green evaluation criteria for cosmetics using an expert panel of thirty Indian cosmetic users using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) and investigate the impact of a comprehensive list of antecedents on the multi-criteria category consumption decision. Findings: The study results indicate that perceived consumer effectiveness is the most critical factor for green cosmetics consumption in India, followed by brand trust, behavioural control, and environmental effectiveness. The least important factors are price and social norms. Research limitations/implications: As the GC category is at nascent stage in India the investigation is limited to the GC category innovators – a set of people high in intellectual and financial resources. The study is also limited to women users as the male cosmetic market in the country is still very small. Practical implications: The study results can help marketers in designing and implementing GC related marketing strategies to deliver higher customer value to the target segment. Academicians can use the study results for better prediction of category related behaviour of consumers. Social implications: The study results will help promote GC category adoption and usage which can benefit the environment and consumer health. Originality/value: The study contributes to literature and practice by assessing a comprehensive set of critical antecedents to GC adoption using a novel approach of F-AHP and an expert user panel. The study results offer insights to marketers that can be used to develop suitable strategies to convert non-GC users into GCs in India and similar markets, improving category penetration and benefitting marketers, retailers, users, and the environment. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Srivastava R.; Sanjeev M.A.; Gupta S.,Tactical,10.1108/IJRDM-09-2022-0340,Antecedents; Behavioral control; Brand trust; Consumer effectiveness; Environmental effectiveness; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Green cosmetics,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study investigates specific factors influencing consumer behavior towards green cosmetics in India, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into actionable marketing strategies.",scopus-prediction,20,60,A fuzzy approach to determining antecedents to green cosmetic consumption in India,2024
"This special communication provides a physicians' critique of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s decision to authorise the Vuse Solo (Vuse) Premarket Tobacco Application (PMTA). The PMTA authorisation represents the first time that FDA has authorised an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) for marketing in the USA. Using the FDA Decision Summary, the special communication identifies significant unanswered public health and scientific questions that prevent the authors from reaching FDA's conclusion that Vuse meets the Appropriate for the Protection of the Public Health (APPH) standard. The authors recommend FDA suspend the market authorisation and use these questions to re-evaluate the PMTA, and to prospectively monitor whether Vuse meets APPH standard. The special communication advances the ENDS harm reduction conversation because it calls for national tobacco regulators to develop an epidemiological prediction of ENDS impact on the population and to expand the scope of their analysis to evaluate the impacts of ENDS on congenital birth defects, abuse liability and non-flavour drivers of youth usage. Through learning from the American experience regulating Vuse, national tobacco regulators around the globe will be better equipped to evaluate the impact of ENDS on the public health.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

"Purpose – The share price of any financial institution fluctuates due to various hidden and visible factors. Predicting share price behavior in the economy and financial marketing theory is crucial but complex. The Industrial Bank of Korea’s (IBK) share prices are also affected by hidden factors, including Korean international trade flow. The study aims to forecast hidden impacts on IBK share prices resulting from the international trade flow in Korea. Design/Methodology/Approach – Two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approaches are employed, one based on exports, and the other on imports, to identify trends and fluctuations in the hidden states influencing visible states. Findings – The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between IBK share prices and both exports and imports. Notably, increasing exports indicate a 50% probability of IBK share prices rising, while falling imports indicate a 56% chance of IBK share prices increasing. These results demonstrate how changes in exports and imports impact IBK’s share price in the Korean stock market. Research Implications – The research implications are valuable for short-and long-term investors in IBK shares and the Korean stock exchange. This research can help decision-makers identify the relationships between and within the visible/observed states that influence the stock price of IBK. © 2023 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

"Purpose: This study explores the impact of owner chief executive officers' (CEO) narcissism on the exporting small to medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) decision-making on the international market expansion speed after their initial entry. Specifically, the authors use the mechanism of firms' international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) to examine how owner CEO narcissism may influence SMEs' post-entry speed of internationalization (PSI), both directly and indirectly. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors draw on data from a two-wave questionnaire and on archival export data from 291 Chinese exporting SMEs in three municipalities and 17 provinces from 2019 to 2020. Findings: The results support the theoretical predictions that owner CEO narcissism shapes exporting SMEs' decisions on PSI, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of firm-level IEO. Originality/value: The study extends emerging research on the role of CEO narcissism in the upper echelons literature into the international marketing (IM) context. It also offers new insights into what drives exporting SMEs' IM decision-making from a psychological microfoundations perspective. Furthermore, the authors theoretically establish and empirically demonstrate the key role of a firm's IEO as a mediator to complement the existing literature's focus on the direct influence of CEO narcissism on firms' internationalization decisions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Li X.; Wang Y.; Yang M.M.; Tang Y.,Strategic,10.1108/IMR-07-2020-0169,IM decision-making; International entrepreneurial orientation; Owner CEO narcissism; Post-entry speed of internationalization; SMEs,5.0,,10,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study investigates the long-term implications of CEO narcissism on SMEs' international market expansion, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making.

"Marketing practices like money-back guarantees (MBGs) are prevalent in many expert-service markets but are often decried as marketing gimmicks that take advantage of vulnerable and poorly informed consumers. In this research, conducted in the market for in vitro fertilization services, the authors empirically assess differences in quality of care between clinics that offer MBG programs and those that don't, to investigate whether MBG programs can serve a purpose consistent with signaling and insurance theories. The analysis is conducted on a unique longitudinal data set that includes information on clinic-level treatment, outcome statistics, clinic characteristics, and marketing practices for fertility clinics in the United States, state-level insurance mandates, competition environments, and demographic and geographic characteristics. Using an instrumental variable approach to account for the endogeneity of MBG decisions made by fertility clinics, the authors find that MBG clinics, on average, offer better treatment outcomes in terms of success rates while undertaking lower risks. The results are consistent with signaling theory predictions that market-based programs like MBGs can serve as signals of unobservable clinic quality despite the incentives for clinics to engage in opportunistic behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2022.",Yu S.; Ghosh M.; Viswanathan M.,Strategic,10.1177/00222437211060733,expert services; health care marketing; in vitro fertilization; information asymmetry; insurance; money-back guarantees; quality of care; signaling,5.0,,10,5,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The research assesses the long-term implications of marketing practices (money-back guarantees) in the context of in vitro fertilization services, and how these practices can influence clinic quality and consumer trust.

"Over time, research on order effects during information searching and choice tasks has received thorough attention in marketing, psychology, and economics. When early information search influences choice in favor of that information, it is called primacy; the equivalent for later information search is called recency. However, research that disentangles primacy and recency effects during multi-attribute product choice, as well as studies on the cognitive processes underlying primacy and recency effects are lacking. I address this gap with two choice-based conjoint experiments combined with eye tracking and by means of multilevel mediation analysis. Consistent with my prediction that to counterbalance the impact of decision irrelevant information on choice through early information search by later information search is mentally too costly, I find that “spatial position” biases choice due to primacy rather than recency. This bias, however, is small. This suggests that for decision irrelevant information, the causal influence of attention on choice generalizes to more complex decisions, though with little impact. Consistent with my prediction that the level of information elaboration moderates the mediation process, increasing task motivation decreases the dominance of primacy. © 2023 The Author.

"The behavioral theory of the firm is an important fundamental theory in the management domain. It describes the strategic decision-making process of a firm as a performance feedback process and argues that performance shortfall, i. e., firms′ failing to achieve their aspirations, would make decision makers launch problemistic search to seek solutions to settling the problem of performance shortfall, consequently leading to organizational changes. Previous studies have established theoretical relationship between performance shortfalls and various kinds of organizational changes. However, no consensus has been reached about the effect of performance shortfalls. On one hand, many studies support the classic predictions of the behavioral theory of the firm and it′s found that performance shortfalls would lead to organizational changes of the firm. On the other hand, some studies indicate contrary evidence that performance shortfalls would reduce firms′ tendency to make organizational changes. This study holds that the way a firm responds to performance shortfall depends on decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfall and on the characteristics of that organizational change. To make up for the research gap described above, this study incorporates managerial ability into the behavioral theory of the firm and focuses on the quantity and the quality of firms′ patent applications with inherent tension. Specifically, this study examines how performance shortfall influences firms′ patenting strategies involving the quantity and the quality of patent applications and how managerial ability moderates the relationships between performance shortfall and patenting strategies. This study investigates managerial ability, because it would influence the performance feedback process of the two patenting strategies by altering decision makers′ interpretation of performance shortfalls. This study focuses on firms′ patenting strategies for the following reasons. First, patenting strategies are common and important strategies for manufacturing firms to respond to performance shortfalls. Second, there is often a tension between the quantity and the quality of patent applications; therefore, decision makers have to weigh up those two options. Investigating the performance feedback processes of them may reveal the different effects of performance shortfall on organizational changes. This study uses a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing listed firms in the period of 2011—2017. The data used in this study are from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) and Wind Database (WIND), which have been widely employed in empirical studies on Chinese firms. To alleviate the potential effect of outliers, this study winsorizes variables with possible outliers at the 1st and 99th percentiles of their distributions. This study employs fixed effect models for panel data to test hypotheses. Fixed effect models can solve the problem that the explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved individual effects. This study uses Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to correct the problems of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. The measurement of the quantity of patent applications is natural logarithm for the total number of patent applications of a firm. The quality of patent applications is measured as the ratio of the number of invention patent applications to the total number of patent applications. Performance shortfall means performance falls below the aspiration level. This study uses return on assets (ROA) to measure firm performance and focuses on social aspiration. Social aspiration is the average performance of all the other firms in focal firm′s industry. This study uses two-step data envelopment analysis (DEA) to obtain the measurement of managerial ability. As to control variables, this study controls R&D intensity, marketing intensity, unabsorbed slack resources, firm size, income tax ratio, the independence of the board, the size of top management team, ownership concentration, proportion of state-owned shares, positive performance discrepancy, industry dummy variables, and year dummy variables. This study suggests that there is a negative relationship between performance shortfalls and the quantity of patent applications so that the more the performance falls short of the performance aspiration, the smaller the quantity of patent applications would be. In addition, managerial ability would undermine this negative relationship. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between performance shortfalls and the quality of patent applications so that the more the performance falls below the performance aspiration, the higher the quality of patent applications would be, and managerial ability would strengthen this positive relationship. © (2023).

"Purpose: This research investigates the novel questions of whether and how specific forms of shopping channels (online vs offline) influence consumers' decision-making. Moreover, this research investigates marketing firms' proper marketing strategies across different shipping channels. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted three studies using a large sample (N = 703) recruited from a diverse pool (students and adults) that examined multiple products (camera and car) across different shopping channels (online vs offline). Study 1a (n = 251) and Study 1b (n = 252) examined the effect of an online versus offline channel on consumers' decision-making using a one-factor (shopping channel: online vs offline) between-subjects design. Meanwhile, Study 2 (n = 200) investigated the effective strategies that firms should employ across different shopping channels using a 2 (shopping channel: online vs offline) × 2 (mental simulation: outcome vs process) between-subjects design. Participants in the online condition evaluated the product on a computer screen, whereas participants in the offline condition evaluated the real product assuming a real-world retail store setting. Findings: The three studies supported the predictions that shopping channels (online vs offline) affect consumers' psychological distance and, in turn, affect their decision process. Specifically, results reveal that the online (offline) channel increases (decreases) psychological distance and leads consumers to pay more attention to a product's desirability (feasibility) aspects.

"With the popularity of social media, extracting consumer preferences from online consumer-generated content is of vital importance for product/service providers to develop tailored marketing strategies. However, existing approaches face difficulties analyzing consumer preferences over different attributes of alternatives (restaurants, hotels, etc.), which hinders product/service providers from comprehensively understanding consumer choice decisions. To address this issue, we solve for the consumer preferences over the attributes represented by attribute weights based on consumers’ historical data, including text comments and overall ratings. Specifically, for each comment and a corresponding rating, we first employ sentiment analysis to calculate values of the attributes, and then develop a quadratic programming model to solve for the weights. Based on a stream of a consumer's text comments and overall ratings, we can correspondingly obtain a stream of weights indexed by the comment time. We then model this stream of weights as hesitant judgments and employ a hesitant multiplicative programming method to solve for the final weights that fit the consumer's preferences over attributes at the highest satisficing level. In the application of recommendation, our approach not only provides insights into the consumer's preferences but also has higher prediction power compared with some state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Zhu B.; Guo D.; Ren L.,Operational,10.1016/j.im.2022.103626,Consumer preference; Decision analysis; Hesitant judgment; Pairwise comparisons; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis,10.0,,60,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on the management of consumer preferences using historical data and sentiment analysis, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer decisions and recommendations.",scopus-prediction,10,20,Consumer preference analysis based on text comments and ratings: A multi-attribute decision-making perspective,2022
"Purpose: This study aims to identify a new model of relative customer satisfaction translated into share of purchases (SOP) with the best-related metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an online customer satisfaction survey to clients of a firm and with a comparative valuation with current competitors by customer. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis, obtaining β for each variable by relating the variables to the SOP, presenting the relative effect of the variables and the best global explanation of the model. Findings: This new model has good prediction accuracy and shows a clear impact of different relative satisfaction indicators and, to a minor degree, business and relationship characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this model is that it is based on data from only one company, but it should have value in other sectors and provide full insight through its transversal application. Originality/value: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers and determined how the improvements in customer satisfaction translate into business growth. The study shows that the relative evaluation of satisfaction carries different meanings for customers, while all of them are better than absolute satisfaction. It includes a more understandable indicator than other prior relative indicators, the difference in satisfaction and is more effective. Additionally, it guides how to take advantage of the knowledge of relative customer satisfaction before competitors and demonstrates the courses of action with the potential best results. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Alet Vilaginés J.,Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-05-2021-0274,Business-to-business marketing; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction model; Customer strategy; Share of purchases; Share of wallet,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Publishing,"The study proposes a model for measuring customer satisfaction that can be applied to improve business decision-making and customer acquisition strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Share of purchases in B2B: relative customer satisfaction indicators and customer characteristics as main influencers,2023
"Purpose: This paper aims to elucidate some of the complexity around food consumption by drawing from neuroscience research of food as a motivated choice (i.e. a neurobehavioral process sensitive to dopaminergic response to food and environmental cues such as marketing). The authors explore the single and compounded effect of the motivational salience of food’s intrinsic reinforcing value tied to its sugar content and that of two marketing food cues, price and in-store display, on actual consumer purchase behavior. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above hypotheses in two perceived “healthy” product categories with a wide distribution of sugar content. The authors estimate a within-category model using three years of retail transaction data to test the effect on weekly sales. Findings: The authors confirm the single effect of each of food’s and marketing cues’ motivational salience as well as their compounded effect with high-motivational-salience food being less price elastic and more susceptible to in-store display activities. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the need to complement current reliance on unhealthy/healthy perception with finer grained objective evidence linked to the formulation of the food itself and the marketing applied to them. Practical implications: The present study findings may help marketing managers and policymakers develop better targeted pricing and display strategies for low- and high-motivational-salience food, attempting to strike a better balance between consumer welfare and commercial performance.

"Purpose: This paper aims to examine how consumers make choices when they are faced with a fixed set of available options, consisting of both preferred and less-preferred choices, in the domain of food consumption. Specifically, the paper offers a novel perspective to predict repeated choice decisions in food consumption, which is termed as “pattern-seeking” – a consumption choice pattern that involves a coherent repetitive sequence of sub-groupings or coherently concentrated sub-groupings of options. Design/methodology/approach: Eight experimental studies that contrast the existing theoretical predictions regarding repeated choices (e.g. primacy effect, recency effect, variety vs consistency) against pattern-seeking were conducted using hypothetical and actual food choices. Findings: The results of experimental studies show that an explicit decision pattern (i.e. pattern-seeking) emerges as the most significant predictor of repeated choice in the food consumption domain. Research limitations/implications: This study offers a novel perspective on how consumers make repeated choices in the domain of food consumption. Practical implications: The results show that consumers prefer food consumption with a pattern (vs non-pattern). Thus, it would be better to generate marketing activities that allow customers to satisfy their pattern-seeking more easily.

"Facing the challenge of attracting consumers and winning market share under the proliferation of TV stations and channels, the traditional TV stations often make some marketing strategies. However, how to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and select the best one is a key issue. This study proposes to resolve this problem. We develop an innovative structural model to simulate the dynamic choices consumers make under two interactive behaviors: learning and forgetting. Learning behavior refers to updating programme quality assessment by using experience, while forgetting behavior prevents the use of previous experience. The Bayesian rules are employed to model learning behavior, and they are extended by incorporating an exponential decay function to measure the effect of forgetting behavior. The structural model is tested and validated by using Hong Kong television viewing data. The empirical results show that when modeling consumer choice decisions, considering learning and forgetting behavior significantly improves the performance of the model in regard to rating prediction and marketing strategy evaluation. Five cases are simulated to show how the model is used to evaluate marketing strategies. Managerial implications are then discussed to guide the decision-making of traditional TV broadcasters and advertisers. © 2020 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Song L.; Fai Tso G.K.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jmse.2020.05.002,Bayesian updating theory; Dynamic learning; Forgetting; Marketing strategy evaluation,5.0,,15,0,KeAi Communications Co.,"The study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of marketing strategies for traditional TV stations, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"Business-to-business (B2B) customer retention relies heavily on analytics and predictive modeling to support decision making. Given this, we introduce uplift modeling as a relevant prescriptive analytics tool. In particular, the uplift logit leaf model offers a segmentation-based algorithm that combines predictive performance with interpretability. Applied to a real-world data set of 6432 customers of a European software provider, the uplift logit leaf model achieves superior performance relative to three other popular uplift models in our study. The accessibility of output gained from the uplift logit leaf model also is showcased with a case study, which reveals relevant managerial insights. This new tool thus delivers novel insights in the form of customized, global, and segment-level visualizations that are especially pertinent to industrial marketing settings. Overall, the findings affirm the viability of uplift modeling for improving decisions related to B2B customer retention management. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",De Caigny A.; Coussement K.; Verbeke W.; Idbenjra K.; Phan M.,Tactical,10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.10.001,Churn prediction; Customer retention; Interpretability; Segmentation-based modeling; Uplift modeling; Visualization,5.0,,15,0,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses the application of uplift modeling for B2B customer retention, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights and decision-making tools.

"This paper proposes a decision support system based on a machine-learned Bayesian network (BN) to predict the success rate of telemarketing calls for long-term bank deposits. Telemarketing is one of the most common interactive techniques of direct marketing, widely used by financial institutions such as banks to sell long-term deposits. In this study, we develop a BN model that predicts the likelihood that a potential client subscribes to a long-term deposit, which is considered an output variable. The causal relationship among client attributes and outcomes has been identified using the augmented Naïve Bayes approach, a well-known supervised learning algorithm. The impact of each client's attribute on the likelihood of subscribing is predicted.

"When preferences are sensitive to context, firms may influence purchase decisions by designing the environment of consumption choices. This paper studies how competitive retailers optimally design their product line if preferences at the store depend on whether the choice set draws consumer attention to the quality or price of a product. Before making a purchase decision, a consumer chooses among retailers without (fully) anticipating that her preferences at the store are malleable. We show that this setup can align evidence on retailer marketing practices and the existence of loss leaders with the experimental literature on decoy effects: in equilibrium, retailers use loss leaders to attract the consumer to the store and decoy products to draw consumer attention at the store to more profitable alternatives featuring a higher price (inducing a profitable upsell) or lower production cost (inducing a profitable downsell). We embed and compare the predictions of three recent specifications of choice-set dependent attention - namely, Salience, Focusing, and Relative Thinking. All three specifications predict that firms construct choice environments that utilize decoy effects to up- or downsell the consumer. Because they differ in how attention can be directed using the product line, however, they differ in their predictions of how the decoy will be positioned in the price-quality space.  © 2020 INFORMS.",Apffelstaedt A.; Mechtenberg L.,Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.2020.3675,Context; Decoys; Downselling; Focusing; Naïveté; Relative thinking; Retailer competition; Salience; Upselling,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses how retailers can design product lines and marketing strategies to influence consumer choices, which falls within the tactical level of decision-making.

"Many e-commerce platforms provide marketing tools to help their sellers attract customers and enhance user experience. However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers’ choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers’ differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers’ payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms’ strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms’ strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools. © 2021 INFORMS.",Yang B.; Yang S.; Dutta S.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2021.1325,behavioral economics; business-to-business marketing; choice modeling; cognitive hierarchy; competition; competitive analysis; electronic commerce; marketing tools; sales response parameters,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses a theoretical framework for understanding business customers' choices regarding marketing tools on e-commerce platforms, indicating long-term strategic planning and decision-making.

"Purpose: The authors aim to obtain the optimal combinations of factors from institutional environment adaptation mechanisms and internal resources or capabilities that influence the sustainability of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a new index, called the sustainability index, based on the stakeholder perspective by employing a corporate credit risk index, an evaluation of a firm's corporate governance, corporate financial performance and firm age. The authors then apply both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Analysis and Fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (FsQCA) to obtain the optimal models for firms' sustainability. Findings: The OLS analysis shows that the variables including financial leverage, slack, innovation capability, manufacturing capability and human capital that have significant influences on the sustainability of firms. Our FsQCA analysis obtains configurations of several solutions for firm sustainability and concludes that the fit of combinations of institutional factors and/or internal resources and capabilities of a firm is related to its sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The limitations in our new index include these: first, one may add more key metrics to measure the index; second, the findings do not provide any necessary nor a sufficient condition to get sustainability for sure. The limitations of using multiple regression analysis are that it is not able to reveal the combinations of causal conditions that can lead to the outcome in the real world as well as to the sustainability of a firm in our study. To overcome the limitations, the authors apply fsQCA analysis to identify combinations of causal conditions to a firm's sustainability in our study. Practical implications: Introducing the sustainability index enables us to find out all factors influencing the sustainability of a firm. The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world. Their analysis enables managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. For example, the authors’ fsQCA analysis shows that low marketing capability will lead to the high sustainability of the firm. This information helps managers to make the decision or plan to achieve good results toward their businesses and get better allocate their resources and get a better investment. Social implications: The authors’ analysis can be used to identify combinations of causal conditions to lead to outcomes in the real world and enable managers to know how to predict the sustainability of the firm. A correct prediction can assist companies in developing their future operations, which would enhance their competitiveness vis-à-vis rivals during this time of global economic volatility, which, in turn, enables firms to perform better and employ more employees that could help the entire society. Originality/value: The sustainability index the authors developed in our paper is new in the literature and the findings obtained by both OLS Regression Analysis and FsQCA are new in predicting a firm's sustainability.

"Context: Positive health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes can have important implications for equity, efficiency and timely patient access to novel therapies. Several outcomes and dimensions of benefit beyond utility feed into HTA processes. Objective: We analyse a proprietary dataset of HTA outcomes in 7 countries, to (a) test whether HTA decision-making is grounded in welfarist or extra-welfarist approaches; and (b) empirically determine the factors associated with positive HTA outcomes, the time to achieve these and establish the magnitude of inter-country differences in assessment processes. Methods: Data were extracted from publicly available HTA reports on drugs that received marketing authorisation between 2009 and 2018 (N = 1415). The outcomes of interest were the probability of positive HTA outcomes and the time-to-HTA outcome; these were examined with respect to clinical, regulatory, product- and disease-related, evidence uncertainty and contextual variables. Econometric models utilising survival analysis and multinomial logistic regression were specified. Findings: Positive HTA outcomes accounted for 87.3% of the sample (n = 1235), of which 71% (n = 1004) were restricted. Drugs with positive HTA outcomes were subject to clinical restrictions (n = 652, 46%), financial risk-sharing (n = 439, 31%) or had been rejected at least once (n = 282, 20%). Significant predictors of positive HTA outcomes were orphan drugs with cancer indications, high quality of evidence linked to clinical and economic evidence uncertainties which had been overcome, and contextual considerations, particularly innovativeness and unmet need. Comparative analyses revealed systematic differences between countries in their propensity to accept the same drugs, particularly oncology and orphan drugs. Conclusions: Our results are contextual and reinforce arguments in favour of explicitly accounting for social value judgements, establishing separate assessment frameworks for highly uncertain products, adopting risk mitigation strategies for novel therapies with early phase evidence, and sharing of HTA practices across settings. Lastly, HTA agencies have adopted an extra-welfarist approach to value assessment and resource allocation. © 2023 The Authors",Kanavos P.; Visintin E.; Gentilini A.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116045,Affordability; Cost-effectiveness; Drug pricing; Extra-welfarism; Health technology assessment; Priority setting; Social value judgements; Uncertainty,,0.0,0,100,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes and their implications for patient access to therapies, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-prediction,0,0,Algorithms and heuristics of health technology assessments: A retrospective analysis of factors associated with HTA outcomes for new drugs across seven OECD countries,2023
"Despite the relentless growth of online retail, e-commerce platforms still suffer from a low purchase conversion rate. Researchers and practitioners have attempted to understand customer purchase behavior, but it remains elusive due to customers' heterogeneous and complex decision-making processes. This study addresses a gap in existing research by combining two types of factors affecting purchase behavior: past customer characteristics and current website browsing behavior. This study employs recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) to extract variables of customer characteristics and utilizes graph metrics to comprehensively measure browsing patterns. Based on these variables, this study conducts predictive analysis for purchase behavior and clustering analysis for session-level customer segmentation.

"This research aims to investigate the relationship between prior spending and unplanned purchases based on an understanding of decision framing effects and compensatory psychology. We argue that the impact of prior buying on unplanned purchases is moderated by the decision frame (separate vs. integrated). We conducted a series of four sequential scenario-based experimental studies to support our theoretical predictions. Consequently, our study revealed that travelers within a separate decision frame exhibited a stronger compensatory motive, leading to a higher unplanned purchase when prior spending was low. In practice, this research has managerial implications using compensatory consumption marketing strategies. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Kim J.; Lee E.; Park S.-Y.I.; Chung N.; Koo C.,Tactical,10.1080/10548408.2024.2309195,choice architecture; Compensatory consumption; decision frame effect; psychological marketing strategy; reference price; unplanned purchase,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses the relationship between prior spending and unplanned purchases, focusing on decision framing effects and compensatory psychology.

"Purpose: This study aims to determine the effect of Islamic branding, experiential marketing and word of mouth on college decisions and to find marketing strategies through strengthening Islamic branding based on experiential marketing to increase the number of students at Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative method, with data collection carried out using a survey method by giving questionnaires to respondents. The respondents' criteria are active students, at least in semester three, who have studied at Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education in Indonesia, using a sampling technique with accidental sampling. Data analysis used Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling to determine the estimated results or model predictions. Findings: The results showed a significant direct effect of experiential marketing, Islamic branding and word of mouth on college decisions. There is an indirect effect between experiential marketing and Islamic branding on college decisions through word of mouth, but the word-of-mouth variable could not mediate the relationship between experiential marketing and Islamic branding on college decisions perfectly. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the results of the study is that it uses respondents who are and have participated in learning activities on the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education, where the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education has added value compared to other private campuses. The added value on the Muhammadiyah-Aisyiyah Higher Education is the overall learning activity based on Kemuhammadiyahan Islam in Indonesia.

"Purpose: Cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns have become common features of the marketplace. CRM often involves a for-profit business agreeing to contribute a specified amount to a cause when the business’s customers engage in revenue-generating exchanges. Despite the central role that price is likely to play in a consumer’s decision to purchase or not to purchase an offer associated with a CRM campaign, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, very few have examined price framing effects in a CRM context. This paper aims to explore the effect of rightmost digits manipulation in prices on participation intentions for CRM campaigns. Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, 241 college students participated in an online experiment for class credit. The experiment used a 3 (price level: low, medium and high) × 2 (price ending: 99 ending and no ending) between-subjects design. The dependent variable was participation intention, and several moderators and mediators were considered. PROCESS was used to test the moderated mediation. In Study 2, 351 subjects participated in an online experiment with a design similar to the earlier study. In Study 2, however, new mediators were added and the moderated mediation was tested using SPSS PROCESS macro. Findings: This research shows that price ending impacts the effectiveness of CRM as a tactic on consumers’ purchase intentions. Consistent with the authors’ prediction, this study shows that consumers exposed to a 99-ending CRM offer are more likely to participate in the offer compared to consumers exposed to a no-ending priced offer. Offer attractiveness, elaboration and corporate social responsibility were also shown to have a strong effect on participation intentions. Practical implications: This research indicates that for moderately priced products, 99-ending prices led to an increased influence on consumer purchase intentions; on the other hand, no-ending/even-ending prices were more effective for high-priced products. Thus, the use of the right digit effect by managers in a CRM context as way of increasing consumers’ participation likelihood is likely to be more successful for moderately priced offers. Originality/value: This research extends previous work on CRM and right digit effect in pricing. This study’s findings, in both Studies 1 and 2, demonstrate that the effectiveness of CRM campaigns on consumer choice is dependent on the offer price ending. Consumers exposed to the no-ending priced CRM offers tend to be affected less by CRM campaigns compared to consumers exposed to 99-ending offers, who perceive the offer as more attractive. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Jaber M.; Jaber K.,Tactical,10.1108/JCM-12-2018-2993,99 ending; Cause-related marketing; Framing; Pricing; Right digit effect,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,The abstract discusses the manipulation of price endings in cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns and their direct impact on consumer participation intentions.

"Competitive markets and customers' changing needs in the bank industry necessitate accurately predicting customers who may leave the firm in the near future. Consequently, creating an approach to predict precisely and identify churn-leading causes is a part of retention strategies in customer relationship management. The approach that has been utilized in this research to predict customer churn combines decision tree (DT) and multinomial regression (MR) to classify customers with no limitation of binary classification in the churn prediction context. A customer club dataset of a commercial bank case as a real churn problem is used in this study to benchmark the hybrid forecasting approach against its building blocks. The results showed that the hybrid forecasting approach outperformed DT and MR with an average accuracy of 87.66%, 90.74% micro-average, and 90.44% macro-average of AUC. Further analysis of the model performance per class indicated that the hybrid approach's misclassification error for the churn class decreased significantly, which is the most costly error in churn problems. Moreover, due to the structure of hybrid forecasting approach, more interoperability is obtained by assessing the impact of features in different segments, resulting in transforming them into actionable insights. The proposed approach is applied to the banking industry to prevent financial loss by detecting leading churn causes. Accordingly, after predicting the risk of customer churn, marketers and managers can determine appropriate actions that will have the most significant retention impact on each customer by applying proactive retention marketing. © World Scientific Publishing Co.",Rouhani S.; Mohammadi A.,Tactical,10.1142/S0219649222500897,banking industry; Churn prediction; Customer Churn; decision tree; hybrid approach,5.0,,15,0,World Scientific,"The abstract discusses a specific approach to predict customer churn, which involves structured decision-making and analysis to optimize marketing efforts.

"Increasing numbers of consumers who engage in the development of new products are selling their innovations on online marketplaces. We contribute to the scarce research on the commercialization activities of consumer innovators by comparing the consumers’ price decisions with the pricing of firms. Our predictions build on the baseline assumption that the price decisions of consumers are influenced by the same motivations that originally prompt them to innovate. We use a sequential mixed-method approach with a quantitative main study and follow-up qualitative research. The quantitative results draw on a matched-pair analysis of 4,242 computer games released on the online game platform Steam. We find that consumer innovators charge lower prices than firms for comparable games and that consumers and firms show different inclinations in aligning prices with the games’ development costs and perceived quality. The subsequent interview study with 29 hobbyist game developers provides clear support for the motivational explanations of consumers’ pricing decisions. The findings contribute to research on consumer innovation marketing and nascent entrepreneurship. They also improve the understanding of welfare effects resulting from increasing commercial activities of consumers. © 2020",Ebbing T.; Lüthje C.,Strategic,10.1016/j.respol.2020.104169,Computer games; Consumer innovators; Innovation; Marketplaces; Pricing; User innovation,5.0,,10,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on the long-term implications of consumer innovators' pricing decisions compared to firms, which is relevant to strategic planning and understanding market dynamics.",scopus-prediction,60,25,Pricing decisions of consumer innovators,2021
"This research explores how tourist site management and human attitudes and behaviours can help decrease the pressure of tourism on the environment. Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience. © 2020 by the authors.

"E-commerce has become an integral part of businesses for decades in the modern world, and this has been exceptionally speeded up during the coronavirus era. To help businesses understand their current and future performance, which can help them survive and thrive in the world of e-commerce, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that conducts performance prediction and evaluation of the e-commerce industry by combining the Grey model, i.e., GM (1, 1) and data envelopment analysis, i.e., the Malmquist-I-C model. For each e-commerce company, GM (1, 1) is applied to predict future values for the period 2020–2022 and Malmquist-I-C is applied to calculate the efficiency score based on output variables such as revenue and gross profit and input variables such as assets, liabilities, and equity. The top 10 e-commerce companies in the US market are used to demonstrate model effectiveness. For the entire research period of 2016–2022, the most productive e-commerce marketplace on average was eBay, followed by Best Buy and Lowe’s; meanwhile, Groupon was the worst-performing e-commerce business during the studied period. Moreover, as most e-commerce companies have progressed in technological development, the results show that the determinants for productivity growth are the technical efficiency change indexes. That means, although focusing on technology development is the key to e-commerce success, companies should make better efforts to maximize their resources such as labor, material and equipment supplies, and capital.

"Customer metrics help firms manage their performance and predict financial outcomes. While many firms focus on customer satisfaction metrics for this purpose, dual-process theories in psychology and neuroscience show that customer decisions are based on two processes. This suggests that metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase decisions might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of consumer choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence choice in different ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice directly, the satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty intention. Moreover this relationship is moderated by product involvement such that impulsiveness metrics provide a better prediction for low-involvement than for high-involvement situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of 101 firms demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but distinct relationships with shareholder value.

Although prior studies generally agree on the importance of online WOM, we have little knowledge of the interplay between online user reviews and professional reviews. This paper empirically investigates a mediation model in which online user reviews mediate the impact of professional reviews on online user decisions. Using software download data, we show that a higher professional rating not only directly promotes software download but also results in more active user-generated WOM interactions, which indirectly lead to more downloads. The indirect impact of professional reviews can be as large as 20 percent of the corresponding total impact. These findings deepen our understanding of online WOM effect, and provide managerial suggestions about WOM marketing and the prediction of online user choices.

"Purpose: Grocery retailers have access to detailed data on consumer purchases within their own chains. Previous research has used across-chain scanner panel data to develop optimal price cuts targeted to individual households but whether such a targeting strategy will work with only within-chain data is unknown. The purpose of this research is to address this specific question. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use scanner panel data from multiple categories to create across-chain and within-chain purchase histories for the same consumers. They then estimate models of purchase decisions on the two datasets and compare their performance. Findings: Within-chain data fares significantly worse on both fit and prediction criteria. Retailers' upside to customizing is minimal compared to those reported for manufacturers. Finally, customized prices based on the within-chain model significantly underperform the promise of across-chain data. Research limitations/implications: Store choice is not modelled. Research also needs to be replicated in other contexts. The authors conclude that limited purchase histories may not yield accurate enough estimates of marketing mix responsiveness, and that across-chain purchase histories are essential for effective targeted price cuts. Practical implications: Loyalty card data may be useful for other purposes, like experimenting with segment-specific discounts, but its value in customizing prices at individual level is limited without adding other sources of information. Originality/value: Previous research on price customization has been based almost exclusively on across-store data. However, retailers only have access to their own chain-specific data. This is the first study to comprehensively compare price customization based on within- and across-chain purchase data and show that the upside potential for price customization based on the former information set is quite limited. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Niraj R.; Siddarth S.,Tactical,10.1108/EJM-01-2012-0032,and quantity models; choice; Incidence; Loyalty cards; Retailing; Scanner panel data; Targeted price cuts,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The research focuses on the effectiveness of pricing strategies based on consumer purchase data, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The rate of adoption of digital terrestrial television in Denmark was 100 per cent. In this article, an interdisciplinary approach is utilized to investigate this successful rate of adoption. Diffusion of innovation theory as well as services marketing theory and recent research on adoption of technology are integrated into the theoretical approach. The data gathering is twofold: a survey on the perceived attributes of the innovation was carried out and document data were gathered from government sources. This study shows that a 100 per cent rate of adoption can be achieved with (1) negative perception of the attributes of the innovation; (2) an authority innovation-decision; (3) use of mass communication and interpersonal communication channels; (4) communication in social networks that are not interconnected; and (5) active change agents on a comprehensive and large scale. The influence of the variables is discussed. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

"Purpose – This study aims to develop a new general framework of the challenges for decision making in groups. Unlike most research focused on individual consumption, this study takes a broader perspective on joint consumption. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework and the developed research questions are based on an extensive literature review. Findings – This research identifies five major challenges for group decisions: allocation of responsibilities, preference prediction, preference aggregation, conflicts and mutual influences. For each challenge, this study summarizes existing findings and highlights important areas for continued investigation, related to a marketing-oriented understanding of consumers. This article concludes with implications for both managers and researchers. Originality/value – The identified key determinants of group decisions aggregate findings from multidisciplinary literature and can help marketing researchers and managers understand the relevant but underresearched issues of decision making in groups. Furthermore, this study includes relevant moderators, such as individual and group characteristics, and reveals problematic research gaps. In turn, it offers questions and ideas for additional research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Marchand A.,Strategic,10.1108/JCM-06-2014-1001,Group consumer behavior; Group decision; Joint consumption,10.0,,15,5,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study develops a general framework for understanding group decision-making challenges, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and implications for both managers and researchers in marketing.",scopus-prediction,50,20,Joint consumption challenges in groups,2014
"Poor people often exhibit puzzlingly high sensitivity to low prices of important consumer health goods. This paper proposes decision costs as one explanation: whether a person buys at a price depends on whether she carefully considers the offer, which itself depends on price. A simple model predicts that deliberation costs (1) increase sensitivity to low prices; (2) can prevent cost-sharing from targeting products to buyers with high value; and (3) can have larger effects on poorer people. The principal contribution of this paper is a field experiment that sold hand-washing soap in rural India. Participants were randomly assigned to be offered soap for either a low or very low price, which was experimentally crossed with assignment to a control group or to a treatment that required deliberation. Results matched predictions of the model: the treatment decreased price sensitivity relative to the control group, and increased targeting of product take-up by need. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Spears D.,Tactical,10.1016/j.jebo.2013.06.012,Behavioral economics; Cognitive limits; Cost sharing; Deliberation costs; Development economics; Field experiment; Handwashing with soap; Pricing; Social marketing,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses decision costs and price sensitivity in consumer behavior, particularly in the context of a field experiment targeting soap sales in rural India.

"Although the transaction cost analysis (TCA) has long been used by marketing and management scholars to study organizational buyers' make-or-buy decisions, it sheds limited light on their choice behavior beyond the make-or-buy trade-off. In the meantime, many organizational purchase decisions are structured around which independent supplier to buy from, rather than a typical make-or-buy decision. This study extends existing research on TCA by applying this theoretical framework to explore why organizational buyers make purchases from among independent suppliers. The article posits that (1) two forms of relationship governance—buyer trust and market (i.e., the relative dependence between the buyer and supplier)—help explain the differences in buyer decision-making uncertainty involving independent suppliers, which further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase; and that (2) trust further influences the buyers' propensity to purchase due to its effect on customer perceived value. The empirical study based on organizational purchasing decisions lends support to the predictions of the relationship governance theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Gao T.,Tactical,10.1080/15332667.2017.1357522,business-to-business marketing; decision-making uncertainty; organizational buyers; outsourcing; perceived value; relationship governance; supplier selection,5.0,,20,5,Routledge,"The abstract discusses organizational buyers' decision-making regarding purchasing from independent suppliers, focusing on relationship governance factors like trust and market dependence, which fits within tactical decision-making related to specific purchasing behaviors.",scopus-prediction,10,60,A Relationship Governance Perspective of Organizational Buyers' Supplier Choice Decisions,2017
"Managing marketing resources over time requires dynamic model estimation, which necessitates specifying some parametric or nonparametric probability distribution. When the data generating process differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however, only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less) when sales are low (high). © 2017 INFORMS.",Rubel O.; Naik P.A.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2016.1010,Dynamic games; Kalman filter; Nonprofit marketing; Optimal control; Robust estimation; Sandwich estimator,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses methods for estimating dynamic marketing models and provides insights on advertising effectiveness and budget allocation, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics and campaign optimization.",scopus-prediction,15,70,Robust dynamic estimation,2017
"This study uses data from a special subsample of the National Agricultural, Food, and Public Policy Preference Survey to assess use of weather data for agricultural decision making. Responses from 284 Arizona farmers and ranchers were used to examine (i) the importance producers placed on different types of weather data for production and marketing decisions; (ii) which producer characteristics accounted for differences in the importance they placed on weather data; (iii) producer use of weather data for specific production and marketing decisions; and (iv) which factors distinguish weather data users from nonusers.Amodel of demand for weather information was developed and used to specify count data and discrete choice multivariate regression models. The intensity of weather data use was greater among producers with diversified agricultural production. Diversified producers were more likely to use data for timing of planting, cultivation, and harvest. Weather data use was lower among producers with greater reliance on off-farm income. Producers who rated government risk-management programs as important also found more weather data types important and used weather data for more decisions. Access to satellite TV increased data use but access to the Internet did not. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",Frisvold G.B.; Murugesan A.,Tactical,10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00022.1,,5.0,,15,0,,"The study focuses on specific agricultural decisions influenced by weather data, which aligns with tactical decision-making, interpreting strategic goals into structured actions for producers.",scopus-prediction,10,70,Use of weather information for agricultural decision making,2013
