"While data-driven innovation (DDI) is receiving substantial attention from academics and industry specialists, there is limited research on its dimensions and effects in marketing. We address this theoretical gap by examining the following research questions: 'What are the necessary firm-level capabilities of DDI and its effects in a marketing environment?' Drawing from the resource-based view (RBV), dynamic capabilities (DC), and market orientation theories, this study presents a data-driven innovation capabilities (DDIC) framework and proposes a new conceptualisation with new data product performance through new data product creativity. Based on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, the findings offer seven propositions to enrich the emerging DDI theory in marketing and guide managerial decision making.","Sultana, S; Akter, S; Kyriazis, E",Strategic,10.1080/0965254X.2021.2013934,Data-driven innovation; data-driven innovation capabilities; management capabilities; infrastructure capabilities; talent capabilities; market orientation; dynamic capabilities; new data product creativity; new data product performance,5.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses data-driven innovation (DDI) in marketing and examines firm-level capabilities and their effects, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic frameworks.",wos-big data,60,20,Theorising Data-Driven Innovation Capabilities to Survive and Thrive in the Digital Economy,2022
"Drawing on 55 interviews with executives across five online fashion retailers, this paper explores the challenges of price setting and management. We develop a descriptive model of 'locked-in' pricing practice to explain organisational routines focused on cost-plus pricing, alignment with competitor prices and historical pricing. Drivers include the complex and uncertain outcomes of pricing, and lack of investment in leading-edge pricing methodologies, together with inadequate training and pricing ownership. Outcomes comprise an aversion to price risk-taking, sees decisions guided by heuristics and a lack of openness to alternative pricing methods. We offer implications for pricing practice to overcome these locked-in behaviours and suggest that research addresses challenges encountered in the implementation of new pricing techniques in organisational settings to narrow the gap between theory and practice.","Wood, S; Watson, I; Teller, C",Strategic,10.1080/0267257X.2021.1900334,Online retail; big data; retail pricing; merchandising; pricing practices,5.0,,10,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses pricing practices and challenges faced by organizations, indicating a focus on long-term pricing strategies and implications for overcoming locked-in behaviors, which aligns with strategic decision-making.",wos-big data,60,25,Pricing in online fashion retailing: implications for research and practice,2021
"The authors propose a new, exploratory approach for analyzing market structures that leverages two recent methodological advances in natural language processing and machine learning. They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.","Gabel, S; Guhl, D; Klapper, D",Tactical,10.1177/0022243719833631,market structure analysis; product maps; machine learning; retailing; big data,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The proposed approach focuses on analyzing market structures and deriving product attributes, which directly aids retailers in making targeted decisions regarding product assortment and cross-category complementarity.

"Abundant consumer data has made decision-making more complicated, rather than simple, for marketers. This raises an important question about which variables in the data contain reliable information for retailers to predict future consumer purchase value (CPV) to guide strategic decisions. The authors address this question by exploring the variables distinctive choice of brand country of origin (DBCOO) and country of origin diversity (COO diversity) as analytical tools to extract insights from consumer purchase data. Building on signaling theory, the authors theorize and empirically test that DBCOO and COO diversity in a consumer's purchase history can signal, and therefore help predict, CPV. Moreover, the authors explore high-involvement product categories and purchase frequency as boundary conditions to develop a comprehensive framework of COO signals as strategic analytical tools. They find that DBCOO in a consumer's purchase history indeed increases CPV and that this relationship is enhanced for high-involvement product categories but moderated curvilinearly by purchase frequency. Moreover, they find that the COO diversity-CPV link is positive but interacts negatively with both moderators. This allows retailers to successfully distinguish high- from low-CPV consumers and thus enables them to manage the marketing mix and resources more effectively.","Rahman, RU; Heinberg, M; Banerjee, S; Katsikeas, CS",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X241254038,country of origin; consumer analytics; consumer purchase value; COO diversity; consumer-based strategy; high-involvement product,5.0,,5,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract focuses on long-term decision-making for marketers by utilizing consumer data to predict future consumer purchase value, which aligns with strategic planning.

"In the age of big data, companies store practically all data on any client transaction. Making use of this data is commonly done with machine-learning techniques so as to turn it into information that can be used to drive business decisions. Our interest lies in using data on prepaid unitary services in a business-to-business setting to forecast client retention: whether a particular client is at risk of being lost before they cease being clients. The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost. This knowledge permits a company to focus marketing efforts on such clients as early as three months in advance.","Schaeffer, SE; Sanchez, SVR",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.101918,Client retention; Sales forecasting; Machine learning; Prepaid unitary services,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning to forecast client retention, which aligns with tactical decision-making by interpreting strategic goals into specific targets and structured actions, such as focusing marketing efforts on clients at risk of leaving.",wos-big data,20,60,Forecasting client retention - A machine-learning approach,2020
"Social network (SN) platforms have become ubiquitous in most countries. However, the reliability of the in-formation shared and the structural mechanisms that govern the discussions is constantly being questioned. There is a need for understanding the mechanism for information dissemination and developing decision aids that can help decipher information validity. Our context is the support provided within the mental health community where the diseases are typically chronic and the need for social and medical support is obvious. We employ an analytics approach in the context of social capital theory (SCT) to study the relationship between the structural makeup (i.e., influence) of a user and the characteristics of the knowledge disseminated on a microblogging platform. Different types of information provide various types of support to patients. This paper provides a foundational theoretical framework to create decision aids so that users can decide on relevant information for their needs.","Asamoah, DA; Sharda, R",Out of scope,10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.09.019,Disease self-management; Social networks; Social capital; Data analytics; Marketing analytics; Knowledge management,,0.0,0,100,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,The abstract discusses the dissemination of information in the mental health community and focuses on understanding support mechanisms rather than marketing-related applications.,wos-big data,0,0,What should I believe?

"Purpose - In the data-driven era, the quality of the data exchanged between suppliers and buyer can enhance the buyer's ability to appropriately cope with the risks and uncertainties associated with raw material purchasing. This paper aims to address the issue of supplier selection and purchasing planning considering the quality of data by benefiting from suppliers' synergistic effects. Design/methodology/approach - An approach is proposed to measure data visibility's total value using a multi-stage algorithm. A multi-objective mathematical optimization model is then developed to determine the optimal integrated purchasing plan in a multi-product setting under risk. The model contemplates three essential objective functions, i.e. maximizing total data quality and quantity level, minimizing purchasing risks and minimizing total costs. Findings - With emerging competitive areas, in the presence of industry 4.0, internet of things and big data, high data quality can improve the process of supply chain decision-making. This paper supports the managers for the procurement planning of modern organizations under risk and thus provides an in-depth understanding for the enterprises having the readiness for industry 4.0 transformation. Originality/value - Various data quality attributes are comprehensively subjected to deeper analysis. An applicable procedure is proposed to determine the total value of data quality and quantity required for supplier selection. Besides, a novel multi-objective optimization model is developed to determine the purchasing plan under risk.","Shabani-Naeeni, F; Yaghin, RG",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-02-2020-0108,Performance measurement; Planning; Buyer-seller relationship; Sourcing; Supplier evaluation; Multi-objective decision-making; Business-to-business relationship; Purchasing planning; Supplier data visibility; Data science; Synergy of suppliers,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract focuses on supplier selection and purchasing planning, which are long-term decisions that define organizational goals and strategies in managing risks and uncertainties in the procurement process.

"The association between crime and tourism has been studied for more than 40 years. Most of the studies, however, have focused on differentiating crimes against tourists from crimes against locals despite the high correlation between the two. To date, there are only a few studies that have pointed out to the role of location and time in tourism-crime analysis despite the existence of theoretical frameworks such as routine activity, hot spot, and rational choice that validate the role of temporospatial analysis in tourism/hospitality crimes. Furthermore, prior literature has only used the predictive policing model in relation to police-criminal activities. This study, however, claims that by using the principles of the predictive policing model in conjunction with the community policing model, benefit can be derived from active public participation in preventing/disrupting crimes that have temporospatial patterns. In order to address the gap and achieve the purpose of the study, 160,947 structured observations of Orlando police public records from 2009 to 2015, types and locations of crimes, decision tree models of classification and regression (CART or CRT), and chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) were employed. The results confirm that crimes at recreation/tourism and hospitality venues have a clear temporospatial pattern and, as such, they could potentially be intervened in and reduced with active participation of the public.","Khalilzadeh, J",Not identified,10.1016/j.jdmm.2020.100535,Predictive policing model; Community-policing model; Crime; Decision trees; Destination management,65.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses the relationship between crime and tourism, focusing on temporospatial patterns and community participation in crime prevention, which does not clearly fit into the strategic, tactical, or operational categories as defined.",wos-big data,10,10,Predictive policing in hospitality and tourism venues - The case of Orlando,2021

"Purpose Risk perception is an essential factor affecting how individuals evaluate risk, make decisions and behave. The impact of risk perception on customer purchase behavior has been widely studied; however, the association has been debated. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior and to examine factors that could moderate it. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted a meta-analysis of this relationship and examined factors that could moderate it. Six databases were comprehensively searched. Two reviewers independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality. Pearson's r was used as the effect estimate. A total of 33 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Findings The results revealed a negative relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior. The geographical region, purchase channel and country development level affected the relationship. The correlation between perceived risk and purchase behavior in European consumers was the highest, followed by the correlation in American consumers; the weakest correlation was found in Asian consumers. For consumers in developed countries, perceived risk had a stronger negative influence on customer purchase behavior than that for consumers in developing countries. The perceived risk of online purchase channels had a stronger negative impact on customer purchase behavior than that of offline purchase channels. Originality/value The findings of this review indicate a direct negative relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this review is the first to meta-analytically summarize the impact of risk perception on customer purchase behavior in social sciences research, and it also illuminates new perspectives for future studies.","Li, ZH; Sha, YZ; Song, XP; Yang, KH; ZHao, K; Jiang, ZX; Zhang, QX",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-12-2018-0381,Risk perception; Customer; Purchase behaviour; Meta-analysis,5.0,,20,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the relationship between risk perception and customer purchase behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Consumers generally encounter a multitude of price discounts during a single visit to a retailers' website, yet past research has predominantly examined price discounts in a singular manner. We examine how the influence of a price discount's magnitude on consumer purchase intentions evolves during an online shopping trip. In doing so, we demonstrate that a price discount's magnitude is less predictive of consumers' purchase intentions earlier, but it becomes more predictive later, during an online shopping trip. Thus, placing shallow price discounts early in a shopping visit may enhance the effectiveness of a firm's portfolio of price discounts.","Sheehan, D; Hardesty, DM; Ziegler, AH; Chen, HP",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.06.001,Price discounts; Reference points; Latitude of acceptance; In-store decision-making; Shopper marketing,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses how the timing and magnitude of price discounts can influence consumer purchase intentions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing sales promotions and pricing strategies during online shopping.",wos-big data,10,70,Consumer reactions to price discounts across online shopping experiences,2019
"Purpose Market orientation (MO) (intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness) is known as one of the key concepts in marketing literature. Although prior research has widely focused on the meaning and application of MO, few attempts have been made to explore how market-oriented firms lead to innovation and market performance and what factors actually moderate this relationship. To fill this gap, the present study aims to explore the relationship between MO, innovation and market performance. This study also attempts to examine the intervening role of IT infrastructure, business analytics (BA) capabilities and market turbulence in the proposed model. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a questionnaire-based survey was undertaken to test the proposed hypotheses. To verify the proposed theoretical model, partial least squares (PLS)/structured equation modeling (SEM) was performed with 114 valid survey data. Findings Despite prior studies which postulated innovation performance as the final outcome of MO (Han et al., 1998; Song et al., 2015), this study focused on innovation performance as a mediating outcome which finally leads to market performance. The statistical results approve the putative relationship which means managers would be able to realize the paramount role of innovation as an integral part of achieving higher market performance. In addition, no support was found for the relationship between intelligence generation and responsiveness. This finding shows that not all obtained information can help managers in the decision-making process. Originality/value This study aims to enrich literature by developing a conceptual model to test the link between MO, innovation and market performance. The value of this study is to investigate the roles of flexible IT infrastructure, BA capabilities and market turbulence as the potential moderators in the proposed model. The results advance the understanding of the influence of BA capabilities on the link between intelligence dissemination and responsiveness. Findings also show innovation performance as remarkable and deemed valuable capability, leading to higher performance in marketing-related activities, particularly in highly turbulent markets.","Ashrafi, A; Ravasan, AZ",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-05-2017-0109,Market orientation; Responsiveness; Business analytics capability; Flexible IT infrastructure; Intelligence dissemination; Intelligence generation,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of market orientation, innovation, and market performance, which are key elements of strategic planning in marketing.

"As a marketing strategy, co-branding has become popular among brand manufacturers in recent years. Unlike previous studies on co-branding, we extend the research from manufacturer-to-manufacturer coopetition stra-tegies to a platform-based supply chain. This paper builds two game theory models involving two manufacturers and one online platform, and divides consumers into Mavericks and Herds, who seek uniqueness and uniformity, respectively, and discusses the channel selection and the market positioning strategy. Some interesting findings are obtained, first, the equilibrium decisions are improved and the optimal profits are enhanced by considering the upstream and downstream cooperation. Second, the online retail channel is chosen when the revenue-sharing ratio is medium and the commission rate is low. Third, brand manufacturers have more opportunities to choose the online retail channel when the co-branded product is marketed to Herds, which is summarized as the market segmentation effect.","Ma, DQ; Wang, XQ; Hu, JS; Li, ZC",Strategic,10.1016/j.elerap.2023.101309,Co-branding; Game theory; Sales channel selection; Market segmentation effect; Consumer behavior preferences,5.0,,10,0,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses long-term marketing strategies and decision-making processes related to co-branding within a platform-based supply chain.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose customer behavior analysis based on real-time data processing and association rule for digital signage-based online store (DSOS). The real-time data processing based on big data technology (such as NoSQL MongoDB and Apache Kafka) is utilized to handle the vast amount of customer behavior data. Design/methodology/approach In order to extract customer behavior patterns, customers' browsing history and transactional data from digital signage (DS) could be used as the input for decision making. First, the authors developed a DSOS and installed it in different locations, so that customers could have the experience of browsing and buying a product. Second, the real-time data processing system gathered customers' browsing history and transaction data as it occurred. In addition, the authors utilized the association rule to extract useful information from customer behavior, so it may be used by the managers to efficiently enhance the service quality. Findings First, as the number of customers and DS increases, the proposed system was capable of processing a gigantic amount of input data conveniently. Second, the data set showed that as the number of visit and shopping duration increases, the chance of products being purchased also increased. Third, by combining purchasing and browsing data from customers, the association rules from the frequent transaction pattern were achieved. Thus, the products will have a high possibility to be purchased if they are used as recommendations.","Alfian, G; Ijaz, MF; Syafrudin, M; Syaekhoni, MA; Fitriyani, NL; Rhee, J",Tactical,10.1108/APJML-03-2018-0088,Association rule; Customer behaviour,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer behavior data and the extraction of patterns to enhance service quality in a digital signage-based online store, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes by focusing on specific targets and structured approaches to improve customer engagement and sales.",wos-big data,15,70,Customer behavior analysis using real-time data processing A case study of digital signage-based online stores,2019
"We study the problem of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, where a decision maker, under a given maximum-number-of batch constraint and only able to observe rewards at the end of each batch, can dynamically decide how many individuals to include in the next batch (at the end of the current batch) and what personalized action-selection scheme to adopt within each batch. Such batch constraints are ubiquitous in a variety of practical contexts, including personalized product offerings in marketing and medical treatment selection in clinical trials. We characterize the fundamental learning limit in this problem via a regret lower bound and provide a matching upper bound (up to log factors), thus prescribing an optimal scheme for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first inroad into a theoretical understanding of dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits. Notably, even a special case of our result-when no batch constraint is present- yields that the simple exploration-free algorithm using the LASSO estimator already achieves the minimax optimal O similar to( root ffiffiffiffiffififfi ) regret bound (s0 is the sparsity parameter or an s0T upper bound thereof and T is the learning horizon) for standard online learning in high dimensional linear contextual bandits (for the no-margin case), a result that appears unknown in the emerging literature of high-dimensional contextual bandits.","Ren, ZM; Zhou, ZY",Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.2023.4895,dynamic batch learning; LASSO; high-dimensional statistics; contextual bandits; sparsity,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the development of an optimal scheme for dynamic batch learning in high-dimensional sparse linear contextual bandits, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at implementing strategic goals through specific methodologies and techniques.

"Objective: The identification of museum attributes is essential when analysing the different factors that attract visitors and studying it in order to improve efficiency in museums, as this could affect the use of funds for developing a marketing campaign to attract visitors. This paper offers a literature review that considers museum visits and museum attributes before proposing a methodology. Methodology: The use of big data applied to tourism research is vital, as it allows for the consideration of the opinions of museum visitors. The case study in this paper is the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Madrid, Spain. The method for identifying the attributes consists of a textual analysis of TripAdvisor reviews written in English (2500) and Spanish (2500). The information is captured using WebHarvy and is analysed using Nvivo12. Results: After analysing the thousand words that were used most frequently, the main attributes were detected, as well as whether the perception of these attributes was positive or negative. The museum's location and the building itself were the most highly valued attributes. Other attributes that were valued positively were the peripheral services of the museum, such as its food and beverage services. Limitations: The main limitation is that TripAdvisor is not an entirely reliable source of information, so it will be necessary to obtain more reviews to analyse. Practical implications: The identification of attributes allows for improved decision making, as well as facilitating a better understanding of the museum's visitors' perceptions. Being aware of these aspects enables the modification of the museum's services through proposals for changes and improvements.","Orea-Giner, A; Guerrero, TV",Tactical,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.2,Cultural tourism; Textual analysis; Visitor experience; Attributes; Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum,5.0,,15,0,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,"The abstract focuses on identifying museum attributes and analyzing visitor perceptions, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at improving marketing strategies and enhancing visitor engagement based on specific feedback and data analysis.",wos-big data,10,70,Textual analysis as a method of identifying museum attributes perceived by tourists: An exploratory analysis of Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum in Spain,2020
"While the benefits of CSR may offer suppliers a competitive advantage in their customer market, CSR remains a paradox as firms struggle to strike a balance between the financial, social, and environmental interests of stakeholders. Such confliction is greatly intensified for firms whose core business and/or marketing communi-cations contradict the general social and environmental interests of the society. Considering theories and con-cepts borrowed from consumer behavior that appear to have been influential in explaining pertinent B2B buyer purchasing decisions, this paper empirically investigates the contingency conditions underpinning CSR and its communication effect on organizational customer outcomes. Our results, based on panel data from Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD) and Compustat database, suggest that on average B2B firms' CSR communications significantly enhance their firm value; however, this value enhancing effect is attenuated when controversies weigh in on firms' industry and/or corporate reputations. Specifically, CSR communications have significantly positive impact on firms in regular settings, but the impact becomes negligible or even negative for firms operating in controversial industries or firms face controversial advertising problems.

"Purpose of the study: to understand working capital management in a large dairy company in the state of Minas Gerais, based on the behavioral approach to finance. Methodology: the research strategy based on a single case was chosen, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis tools Originality: extending the analysis of behavioral biases in decisions on investments in financial assets to the management of working capital. Main results: it was found that the most liquid accounts are those influenced by more behavioral biases. The biases present in decision-making are also consistent with the conservative profile indicated by the dynamic working capital management model. Theoretical contributions: the theoretical trade-off liquidity and profitability does not occur since a higher level of liquidity can be caused precisely by the greater profitability and cash generation capacity of the company compared to the sector. Managerial contributions: the management of working capital must assume a more strategic condition in companies and attentive to the behavioral biases of managers.

"Purpose Big data and analytics are being increasingly used by tourism and hospitality organisations (THOs) to provide insights and to inform critical business decisions. Particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty data analytics supports THOs to acquire the knowledge needed to ensure business continuity and the rebuild of tourism and hospitality sectors. Despite being recognised as an important source of value creation, big data and digital technologies raise ethical, privacy and security concerns. This paper aims to suggest a framework for ethical data management in tourism and hospitality designed to facilitate and promote effective data governance practices. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts an organisational and stakeholder perspective through a scoping review of the literature to provide an overview of an under-researched topic and to guide further research in data ethics and data governance. Findings The proposed framework integrates an ethical-based approach which expands beyond mere compliance with privacy and protection laws, to include other critical facets regarding privacy and ethics, an equitable exchange of travellers' data and THOs ability to demonstrate a social license to operate by building trusting relationships with stakeholders. Originality/value This study represents one of the first studies to consider the development of an ethical data framework for THOs, as a platform for further refinements in future conceptual and empirical research of such data governance frameworks.

"Group-buying often fails even when there are satisfactory quantities as not enough consumers join in the required time, which can waste seller, purchaser, and platform operator time resources; therefore, the group buying features require further research. Over a 3 weeks period, around 700 million click-stream records from 1,061,770 users from a stable and continuous time series were allocated to groups of 5 min frequency, and a hybrid neural network model developed to simulate group-buying behavior in four experiments, from which it was found that adding to the cart and adding as a favorite were significant group-buying behavior features, and shopping depth was the main demographic feature, but age was not. Compared with previous ambiguous online consumer feature conclusions on gender, the results revealed that the commodity feature was the main determinant for gender feature significance. The college student feature was found to be a pseudo feature, and should connect with other fixed effects such as low income or education level. This paper is the first to construct an online dynamic group-buying community, which is a new type of social network and could provide a new perspective for social commerce research. A big data neural network-based method for examining group-buying community behavior over time is proposed that can offer novel insights to online vendors for the development of targeted marketing campaigns.","Zhu, Q; Zuo, RX; Liu, S; Zhang, F",Tactical,10.1007/s10660-019-09380-5,BiLSTM; Dynamic group-buying community; Social commerce; Time series,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the use of a hybrid neural network model to simulate group-buying behavior and offers insights for online vendors, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making focused on targeted marketing campaigns and consumer behavior analysis.",wos-big data,10,70,Online dynamic group-buying community analysis based on high frequency time series simulation,2020
"Digitalization transforms how actors conduct activities and exchange resources in business networks. Data-driven start-ups are key actors in this transformation as they are often the first to commercialize novel digital technologies and influence business networks through their strategizing. Extant Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) literature has investigated roles and strategizing in business networks. However, understanding how datadriven start-ups' specificities impact their roles and strategizing is still at its infancy. Specifically, the authors conceptually show that assumptions on how data-driven start-ups strategize contradict strategizing tenets of prior IMP literature. Therefore, previous knowledge on strategizing needs further differentiation. Addressing this research need, theories-in-use and multiple case study research on 23 data-driven start-ups is conducted to examine (1) in what network roles they operate and (2) how they strategize within and across different network roles. The study extends IMP and data-driven business model research by identifying four network roles (enabler, extender, transformer, orchestrator) and developing a specific classification framework for data-driven start-ups. Furthermore, the study shows that IMP tenets apply in specific network roles only to some extent to data-driven start-ups. Finally, three strategizing trajectories are identified, which provide a dynamic perspective to IMP literature for guiding entrepreneurs on strategizing opportunities.","Mosch, P; Winkler, C; Eggert, CG; Schumann, JH; Obermaier, R; Ulaga, W",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.01.023,Digitalization; IMP; Business networks; Data-driven start-ups; Strategizing; Case study research,5.0,,10,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the roles and strategizing of data-driven start-ups within business networks, focusing on long-term impacts and the identification of specific network roles.

"Purpose Technology and market pressures are encouraging localized and small-series production in customer-driven industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the supply chain-, product- and process-design factors for small-series production in EU's textile and apparel industry, to understand configuration decisions, priorities and challenges. Design/methodology/approach An interview study was undertaken with ten companies that represent diverse small-series production models and value chain roles. Interview data was analysed to identify supply network configuration characteristics, decision priorities and challenges. Findings Three small-series production models emerged from the analysis, differing with respect to adoption of process postponement and customization. The findings confirm and extend past research regarding diverse decision priorities and product, process, supply chain structure/relationship configurations. Challenges identified relate to planning (priorities) and implementation (configuration). Whereas competence availability and digital technology challenges are common, several difficulties are linked to production model like tensions related to priorities and small volumes, which are not found with customization. Research limitations/implications Future research can make comparisons with other industry and location contexts; adopt dynamic approaches to distinguish between design and reconfiguration processes; and address indicated paradoxical-tensions. Practical implications The study findings can provide guidance for companies regarding identification of priorities and management of (planning/implementation) challenges impacting small-series production in T&A. Originality/value The paper brings a configuration perspective at the supply chain level to the problem of small-series production implementation, which demands holistic and context-specific understanding.","Harper, S; Pal, R",Tactical,10.1108/JFMM-07-2021-0173,Supply network configuration; Supply chain design; Customization; High-cost countries; Supply chain management,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses specific factors and challenges related to small-series production in the textile and apparel industry, including configuration decisions and priorities.

"PurposeThis paper intends to address the decision-making and coordination of green supply chain (GSC) considering risk-averse manufacturers under mixed carbon policy.Design/methodology/approachThis paper focuses on a GSC consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer is risk-averse (R-A). This paper employs Stackelberg game theory and mean variance analysis to assess the pricing decision-making process under various scenarios. Furthermore, cost-sharing contracts are introduced to coordinate the GSC.FindingsThe research results suggest that the green level of the product and the profit of the GSC under a centralized scenario are higher than those under a decentralized scenario, while the retail price is lower. Under the decentralized scenario, the green level of product, wholesale price and manufacturer's profit in the R-A scenario are lower than the values in the risk-neutrality scenario, while retailer's profit is higher. In addition, when a cost-sharing contract is utilized for coordination in the GSC, it can lead to Pareto improvement, regardless of whether the manufacturer makes risk-neutrality or R-A decisions.Originality/valueThis research provides a deeper understanding of GSC decision-making and coordination strategy under mixed carbon policy with consideration of R-A from a theoretical perspective and provides decision support for enterprises to choose strategies in practice.","Chen, S; Fang, MQ; Wang, LL; Su, JF; Tuo, J",Strategic,10.1108/APJML-01-2024-0065,Risk-averse; Mixed carbon policy; Green supply chain; Cost-sharing contract,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses decision-making and coordination strategies in a green supply chain context, which relates to long-term goals and the strategic planning of organizations in terms of sustainability and risk management.",wos-big data,60,20,Implications of risk-averse manufacturer on coordination of green supply chain with mixed carbon policies,2024
"This research examines the influence of backers' social networks on their backing behavior using data from a large social networking site and a reward-based crowdfunding platform. We distinguish the roles of nodes and ties in a backer's social network and assess the combined and differential effects of these two types of social relationship on the backer's pledge decisions. As backers have different motives for engaging in different crowdfunding campaigns, which range from commercially oriented technological innovation to community-based social development, we further examine how these effects differ between technology-oriented campaigns and social-oriented campaigns. We find that node-level factors (e.g., centrality) have a greater influence on technology-oriented campaigns than on social-oriented campaigns, while tie-level factors (e.g., embeddedness) have a stronger impact on social-oriented campaigns. Considering the two forms of embeddedness in tandem, we find that the effects of relational embeddedness on backers' pledge decisions are not only moderated by structural embeddedness but also contingent on campaign type. These results offer important theoretical insights into the drivers of contribution, which should be considered by crowdfunding operators and campaign proponents seeking to stimulate contribution.","Chung, YH; Li, YW; Jia, JM",Strategic,10.1007/s11747-021-00779-x,Backer behavior; Centrality; Crowdfunding; Embeddedness; Social influence; Social network; Tie strength,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The research explores the long-term influences of backers' social networks on crowdfunding behavior, providing insights that can shape goals and strategies for crowdfunding platforms and campaign proponents.",wos-big data,60,25,"Exploring embeddedness, centrality, and social influence on backer behavior: the role of backer networks in crowdfunding",2021
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the processes whereby organisational actors can seize the opportunities opened up through social media, and the way in which the relative information is managed. This allows these actors to move their occupational boundaries, exploiting the information for performance measurement purposes. The investigation was carried out within an organisational setting, where most occupational dynamics take place. The focus was on the role of artefacts within these occupational dynamics and the analysis drew upon the notion of boundary objects. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on case studies involving two organisations that make use of social media within and across several departments. The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with social media managers, department managers, analysts and financial controllers and senior executives. The results of the qualitative analysis of the interviews were completed with secondary sources of information, company reports, communications, public policies, codes of conduct and social media platform analyses. Findings - This paper has implications for accounting studies, showing how marketing and communications managers entering the field of performance management can take the lead in social media management by collecting information from social media, constructing indicators and gaining ground in several decision-making centres. The findings highlight the role of new artefacts and organisational roles, whose purpose is to build a digital community. This process involves crossing the boundaries between internal functions and the inside and outside environment, with a driving phenomenon becoming visible: hybridisation. Faced with this change, reluctant accountants with a traditional mindset are more likely to observe the process at a distance, focusing more on their routine operations based on conventional data. Originality/value - This paper shows that information derived from social media is already a reality that has gained significance through the construction of boundary objects. The paper highlights a driving phenomenon that is emerging in the surge to occupy the organisational terrain for controlling social media: that of hybridisation. The concept of hybridisation is not new in management accounting studies, but in this study can be applied to carrying out a joint analysis on both the boundary objects and their organisational trajectory. In the context of social media accounting, hybridisation is of central importance if both actors and objects are to be effectively positioned at its boundary.","Arnaboldi, M; Azzone, G; Sidorova, Y",Tactical,10.1108/AAAJ-07-2015-2132,Occupation; Social media; Performance management; Management accounting; Boundary objects; Hybridization,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses how organizational actors can leverage social media for performance measurement and decision-making, which aligns with tactical goals of interpreting strategic objectives into actionable targets within an organization.",wos-big data,20,60,Governing social media: the emergence of hybridised boundary objects,2017
"While there have been many tourism studies exploring business opportunities from online comments, research in the context of sustainable rural tourism is rare. In particular, practitioners involved in rural destinations are usually transformed from farmers who are relatively new to information technology and therefore unable to understand the voices of tourists in a timely and effective manner. Aiming to expand the literature on sustainable rural tourism, this study cuts from tourist satisfaction and proposes a mixed methodology to investigate insights for sustaining rural destinations from online comments. Specifically, the KMeans clustering algorithm is first utilized to discover service attributes that visitors value; then Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), an effective satisfaction analysis tool, is adopted to understand tourist satisfaction; to develop specific sustainable strategies, using an advanced opinion extraction technique this work identified dissatisfaction factors of visitors. 5832 online comments of two adjacent rural destinations (i.e. Hongcun and Xidi) were crawled to validate the proposed methodology. Results show that five service attributes were discovered, including Natural environment, Price, Food, Hospitality, and Culture & heritage; Hongcun's Natural environment and Price require urgent measures, and its Food and Hospitality are at a competitive disadvantage compared to Xidi; detailed factors dissatisfying visitors were identified through opinion extraction technique, based on which specific sustainable strategies are generated for authorities and practitioners. By excavating business opportunities from online reviews via big data analysis and text mining techniques, the proposed methodology advances the academic understanding of promoting rural tourism.","Wu, J; Yang, T",Tactical,10.1016/j.jdmm.2023.100822,Rural destination; Sustainable tourism; Online comments; Tourist satisfaction; IPA/IPCA; Opinion extraction,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER,"The study focuses on interpreting strategic goals related to sustainable rural tourism into actionable insights derived from online comments.

"Sales managers are unlikely to reap the benefits of implementing predictive analytics applications when salespeople show aversion to or lack understanding of these applications. For managers, it is essential to understand which factors mitigate or exacerbate these challenges. This article investigates these factors by studying the implementation of an application that predicts customer churn. Using 9.7 million transactions from a business-to-business company, the authors develop a predictive model of customer churn, implement it in a field experiment, and study its treatment effects using causal forests. Furthermore, the authors manipulate one specific mitigation strategy proposed by prior literature: the fostering of users' realistic expectations regarding the accuracy of an algorithm. The results show that the effectiveness of the churn prediction application strongly depends on customer characteristics (most importantly the predicted churn probability and prior revenue) and salesperson characteristics (technology perceptions, abilities, and selling orientations). Fostering realistic expectations improves the effectiveness of the churn prediction only under very specific circumstances. Two follow-up stimuli-based experiments conceptually replicate key results of the field study. Therefore, this article helps build theory on predictive sales analytics and provides specific guidance to managers aiming to increase their return on analytics investments.","Habel, J; Alavi, S; Heinitz, N",Tactical,10.1177/00222437221151039,predictive analytics; customer churn; sales management; personal selling; causal forest,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a predictive analytics application for customer churn, which involves structured decision-making processes related to sales management and operational strategies.

"The deployment of loyalty card and other consumer data in geographic research brings opportunities to explore and understand patterns of purchasing behaviour in unprecedented detail. However, valid generalisation re-quires thorough evaluation of their potential bias. We argue that, in competitive markets where consumers can choose to shop across competing retailers, loyalty card data from just one of these may not represent a 'complete' view of all purchases, and that this 'completeness' must be controlled for when assessing bias. To this end, we undertake a UK wide analysis of loyalty card data assembled by a major UK grocery retailer and provide guidelines for their effective deployment in the domains of urban and retail analysis. We assess, for the first time, the 'completeness' of circa 500 million customer transactions recorded by a major customer loyalty programme in representing the overall purchasing patterns of circa 16 million consumers across the entire UK, and develop a method by which to do this. Moreover, no operator has complete national store coverage, and so we suggest ways of accommodating this when conducting analysis using loyalty card data. We illustrate the importance of these issues before providing recommendations for the wider use of consumer loyalty card data.","Rains, T; Longley, P",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102650,Retail geography; Loyalty card data; Consumer data; Urban analytics; Retail analytics,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses evaluating loyalty card data and its application in understanding purchasing behavior, which aligns with tactical decisions in marketing analytics and customer acquisition strategies.",wos-big data,10,70,The provenance of loyalty card data for urban and retail analytics,2021
"The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates free flow of online chatter related to customer experience. Twitter is a prominent social media platform for sharing experiences, and e-retail firms are rapidly emerging as the preferred shopping destination. This study explores customers' online shopping experience tweets. Customers tweet about their online shopping experience based on moments of truth shaped by encounters across different touchpoints. We aggregate 25,173 such tweets related to six e-retailers tweeted over a 5-year period. Grounded on agency theory, we extract the topics underlying these customer experience tweets using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The output reveals five topics which manifest into customer experience tweets related to online shopping-ordering, customer service interaction, entertainment, service outcome failure, and service process failure. Topics extracted are validated through inter-rater agreement with human experts. The study, thus, derives topics from tweets about e-retail customer experience and thereby facilitates prioritization of decision-making pertaining to critical service encounter touchpoints.","Mishra, M",Tactical,10.1177/14707853211047515,online customer experience; topic modeling; e-retail; Twitter; latent Dirichlet allocation; agency theory,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,The study focuses on analyzing customer experience tweets related to e-retailers and identifies specific topics that can inform decision-making at a structured level.

"User-generated content across social media platforms is playing an increasingly important role in tourism. Understanding tourists' experiences and opinions about tourism destinations has led to numerous opportunities to provide tourism providers with greater insights. Identifying sentiments, detecting topics of interest, and exploring loyalty behaviors from user-generated content can provide valuable direction for managerial decisions. This paper presents a novel and inclusive approach that uses different analytical techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract sentiments and topics of interest from tourists' conversational data on TripAdvisor from 2002 to 2019. Sentiment analysis revealed that some touristic locations in Jasper National Park are outperforming others in terms of sentiment scores, despite the fact that tourists less frequently reflect on their experiences at these places on social media. Such higher rankings suggest that average sentiment score can be a more informative measure than simple TripAdvisor rankings. This paper also explores destination loyalty statements using a keyword clustering approach. Previous destination loyalty literature was used to develop a keyword list that was applied to search for expressions of loyalty in online reviews. The robustness of loyalty clusters and optimal number of clusters was also assessed prior to final analysis. Four leading loyalty-focused categories of destination offerings were observed: glaciers, waterfalls, lakes and islands, and hiking and trails. Prioritization of visitor experience enhancements relating to these loyalty-inducing destination components are discussed.","Mirzaalian, F; Halpenny, E",Tactical,10.1016/j.jdmm.2021.100598,Nature-based tourism; Tourism experience; Destination loyalty; Use-generated content; Social media analytics; Sentiment analysis; Topic modeling; Text clustering,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER,"The abstract discusses the use of analytical techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to extract insights from user-generated content in tourism, which aligns with structured decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.

"Chatbots engage in real-time conversations with customers. Moreover, they can collect data in a digital landscape that is increasingly sensitive to privacy. The objective of this study was to help strategic marketing decision-makers better understand how and where chatbots can be used effectively to gather consumer data. We analyse whether consumers' privacy concerns influence their adoption. Furthermore, we invest if privacy concerns, and subsequently information disclosure, are significantly influenced by the chatbot's location. In an experimental study (N = 398) we compared the (in)direct effects of the same chatbot in two different locations: Facebook and its own retailer's website. Our results show that interacting with a chatbot on Facebook led to significantly lower attitudes towards chatbots and lower intentions to use chatbots. Both relationships are sequentially mediated via higher privacy concerns and less comfort with information disclosure. Companies therefore need to consider where to deploy their chatbots.","Roozen, I; Raedts, M; Waetermans, G",Tactical,10.1504/IJIMA.2024.139294,chatbot; privacy concerns; information disclosure; Facebook; Facebook messenger; retailer website; adoption behaviour; consumer-firm interaction,5.0,,15,0,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,"The study focuses on understanding how and where chatbots can be effectively used to gather consumer data, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"The use of conversational agents (e.g., chatbots) to simplify or aid consumers' purchase decisions is on the rise. In designing those conversational agents, a key question for companies is whether and when it is advisable to enable voice-based rather than text-based interactions. Addressing this question, this study finds that matching consumers' communication modality with product type (speaking about hedonic products; writing about utilitarian products) shapes consumers' choice and increases choice satisfaction. Specifically, speaking fosters a feeling-based verbalizing focus, while writing triggers a reason-based focus. When this focus matches consumers' mindset in evaluating the product type, preference fluency increases, thereby enhancing choice satisfaction. Accordingly, the authors provide insights into managing interactions with conversational agents more effectively to aid decision-making processes and increase choice satisfaction. Finally, they show that communication modality can serve as a strategic tool for low-equity brands to better compete with high-equity brands.","Schindler, D; Maiberger, T; Koschate-Fischer, N; Hoyer, WD",Tactical,10.1007/s11747-023-00987-7,Conversational agent; Digital assistant; Chatbot; Speaking; Choice,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The study focuses on how to effectively design conversational agents for improving consumer decision-making, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable implementations.

"Chatbots can be used in marketing services to substantially improve the consumer experience. Based on cognitive appraisal theory, this study applied an event-related potential (ERP) approach to investigate consumers' emotional experiences and consumer trust in passive interaction with chatbots versus humans, taking into ac-count objective or subjective tasks in e-commerce. The results showed that chatbot (vs. human) service in-teractions automatically drew more consumer attention at the subconscious stage (i.e., a larger P2); consumers purposefully allocated more resources to regulate the negative emotions elicited by chatbots at the conscious stage (i.e., a larger LPP); and there was a lower trust in chatbots than in humans. Moreover, under subjective tasks, the differences between chatbots and human agents in emotional experience (as reflected by LPP) and trust were amplified.

"The study aims to analyze the factors that influence customers' inclination to utilize chatbots in banking services. The paper employed the technology acceptance model and utilized structural equation modeling to examine the factors affecting consumers' willingness to embrace chatbot services. The survey evaluated various determinants, including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, privacy concerns, and customer satisfaction. Data were collected from 250 bank customers in the Bombay region of India through an online survey employing a random sampling method. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS AMOS. This study identifies the aspects of chatbot technology in the banking sector, such as user interface, content, security, and convenience, that influence customers' decisions to adopt this innovative technology. The results of the analysis revealed path coefficients indicating a significant relationship between information security and perceived usefulness ((3 = 0.286; p = 0.005) and between perceived usefulness and intention to use (beta = 0.489; p < 0.001). Additionally, the path coefficients for design, security, and facilitating conditions were beta = 0.281, beta = 0.193, and beta = 0.136, respectively, all of which held nearly equal significance in the study. The inter -correlations among the variables ranged from 0.346 to 0.854 and were statistically significant.

"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers' preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper's behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.","Lu, SS; Xiao, L; Ding, M",Operational,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,retailing; video analysis; collaborative filtering,10.0,,55,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes an automated garment recommender system that focuses on day-to-day decision-making processes related to consumer preferences and recommendations, indicating a management of daily activities in the retail context.",wos-computer vision,10,25,A Video-Based Automated Recommender (VAR) System for Garments,2016
"Corporate data mining faces the challenge of systematic knowledge discovery in large data streams to support managerial decision making. While research in operations research, direct marketing and machine learning focuses on the analysis and design of data mining algorithms, the interaction of data mining with the preceding phase of data preprocessing has not been investigated in detail. This paper investigates the influence of different preprocessing techniques of attribute scaling, sampling, coding of categorical as well as coding of continuous attributes on the classifier performance of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. The impact of different preprocessing choices is assessed on a real world dataset from direct marketing using a multifactorial analysis of variance on various performance metrics and method parameterisations. Our case-based analysis provides empirical evidence that data preprocessing has a significant impact on predictive accuracy, with certain schemes proving inferior to competitive approaches. In addition, it is found that (1) selected methods prove almost as sensitive to different data representations as to method parameterisations, indicating the potential for increased performance through effective preprocessing; (2) the impact of preprocessing schemes varies by method, indicating different 'best practice' setups to facilitate superior results of a particular method; (3) algorithmic sensitivity towards preprocessing is consequently an important criterion in method evaluation and selection which needs to be considered together with traditional metrics of predictive power and computational efficiency in predictive data mining.

The use of data mining has rapidly become widespread, with applications in domains ranging from credit risk, marketing, and fraud detection to counter-terrorism. In all of these, data mining is increasingly playing a key role in decision making. Nonetheless, many challenges still need to be tackled, ranging from data quality issues to the problem of how to include domain experts' knowledge, or how to monitor model performance. In this paper, we outline a series of upcoming trends and challenges for data mining and its role within OR.","Baesens, B; Mues, C; Martens, D; Vanthienen, J",Strategic,10.1057/jors.2008.171,data mining; learning algorithms; decision support systems; applications; prediction,5.0,,10,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"The abstract discusses data mining's role in enhancing decision support systems and its implications for long-term decision-making in various domains, which aligns closely with strategic planning.",wos-data mining,60,20,50 years of data mining and OR: upcoming trends and challenges,2009
"Sales and marketing is the indispensable department of an organization which leads to the generation of revenue and building customer relationship. Marketing is the process of finding the potential customers and sales is the process of converting those potential customers into real customers. Hence, it is imperative that marketing and sales go hand in hand. Developing marketing strategies needs proper market research which can cover the relevant pointers like demographics, culture, spending power, income and many more. The process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP) is carried out to develop marketing and sales strategies. STP is done by collection of the marketing intelligence. For this process, surveys are also used but data mining has far more effective and better results so far. Organizations tend to take risk because of the importance and relevance of the marketing and sales department. Most of the budget in the organizations is allocated for marketing and promotional activities. For making data-driven and accurate decisions, data mining is used in various fields to extract valuable information and patterns. This paper discusses the use of the data mining concept on marketing. This paper aims to analyze marketing data with k-means data mining clustering techniques and to find the relationship between marketing and k-means data mining clustering techniques.","Gautam, N; Kumar, N",Tactical,10.17323/2587-814X.2022.1.72.82,marketing; k-means; clustering; data mining tools; data mining techniques,5.0,,15,0,"NATL RESEARCH UNIV, HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS","The abstract discusses the development of marketing strategies, the process of segmentation, targeting and positioning (STP), and the use of data mining techniques like k-means clustering for analyzing marketing data.

"Insurance companies that have adopted the application of data mining methods in their business have become more competitive in the insurance market. Data mining methods provides the insurance industry with numerous advantages: shorter data processing times, more sophisticated methods for more accurate data analysis, better decision-making, etc. Insurance companies use data mining methods for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to fraud prevention. The process of insurance premium pricing was one of the first applications of data mining methods in insurance industry. The application of the data mining method in this paper aims to improve the results in the process of non-life insurance premium ratemaking. The improvement is reflected in the choice of predictors or risk factors that have an impact on insurance premium rates. The following data mining methods for the selection of prediction variables were investigated: Forward Stepwise, Decision trees and Neural networks. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for premium ratemaking, as the main statistical model for non-life insurance premium pricing today in most developed insurance markets in the world.","Omerasevic, A; Selimovic, J",Tactical,10.18045/zbefri.2020.2.667,GLM; data mining methods; forward stepwise; decision trees; neural networks,5.0,,15,0,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS","The abstract discusses the use of data mining methods for specific applications in the insurance industry, such as improving non-life insurance premium ratemaking, which involves structured decision-making and clear objectives.

"Calibration refers to the adjustment of the posterior probabilities output by a classification algorithm towards the true prior probability distribution of the target classes. This adjustment is necessary to account for the difference in prior distributions between the training set and the test set. This article proposes a new calibration method, called the probability-mapping approach. Two types of mapping are proposed: linear and non-linear probability mapping. These new calibration techniques are applied to 9 real-life direct marketing datasets. The newly-proposed techniques are compared with the original, non-calibrated posterior probabilities and the adjusted posterior probabilities obtained using the rescaling algorithm of Saerens et al. (2002). The results recommend that marketing researchers must calibrate the posterior probabilities obtained from the classifier. Moreover, it is shown that using a 'simple' rescaling algorithm is not a first and workable solution, because the results suggest applying the newly-proposed non-linear probability-mapping approach for best calibration performance.

"Customers' response is an important topic in direct marketing. This study proposes a data mining response model supported by random forests to support the definition of target customers for banking campaigns. Class imbalance is a typical problem in telemarketing that can affect the performance of the data mining techniques. This study also contributes to the literature by exploring the use of class imbalance methods in the banking context. The performance of an undersampling method (the EasyEnsemble algorithm) is compared with that of an oversampling method (the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) in order to determine the most appropriate specification. The importance of the attribute features included in the response model is also explored. In particular, discriminative performance was enhanced by the inclusion of demographic information, contact details and socio-economic features. Random forests, supported by an undersampling algorithm, presented very high prediction performance, outperforming the other techniques explored.","Miguéis, VL; Camanho, AS; Borges, J",Tactical,10.1007/s11628-016-0332-3,Direct marketing; Response modelling; Customer targeting; Random forests; Class imbalance,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"The study focuses on data mining response models and methods to improve customer targeting in banking campaigns, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing analytics and customer acquisition strategies.",wos-data mining,10,70,Predicting direct marketing response in banking: comparison of class imbalance methods,2017
"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers' preference indicator.","Filipas, AM; Vretenar, N; Prudky, I",Operational,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,decision-making; consumers' preferences; data mining; decision trees; shopping behaviour indicators,5.0,,80,0,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS","The research focuses on understanding consumer preferences and behaviors related to online shopping, which involves precise decision-making about day-to-day consumer behavior and preferences.

"Many marketing problems require accurately predicting the outcome of a process or the future state of a system. In this paper, we investigate the ability of the support vector machine to predict outcomes in emerging environments in marketing, such as automated modeling, mass-produced models, intelligent software agents, and data mining. The support vector machine (SVM) is a semiparametric technique with origins in the machine-learning literature of computer science. Its approach to prediction differs markedly from that of standard parametric models. We explore these differences and benchmark the SVM's prediction hit-rates against those from the multinomial logit model. Because there are few applications of the SVM in marketing, we develop a framework to position it against current modeling techniques and to assess its weaknesses as well as its strengths.","Cui, DP; Curry, D",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1050.0123,automated modeling; choice models; kernel transformations; multinomial logit model; predictive models; support vector machine,10.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the use of support vector machines for predicting outcomes in marketing, which aligns with strategic planning and long-term decision-making regarding marketing techniques and their effectiveness.",wos-data mining,60,20,Prediction in marketing using the support vector machine,2005
"When considering a decision tree for the purpose of classification, accuracy is usually the sole performance measure used in the construction process. In this paper, we introduce the idea of combining a decision tree's expected value and variance in a new probabilistic measure for assessing the performance of a tree. We develop a genetic algorithm for constructing a tree using our new measure and conduct computational experiments that show the advantages of our approach. Further, we investigate the effect of introducing diversity into the population used by our genetic algorithm. We allow the genetic algorithm to simultaneously focus on two distinct probabilistic measures-one that is risk averse and one that is risk seeking. Our bivariate genetic algorithm for constructing a decision tree performs very well, scales up quite nicely to handle data sets with hundreds of thousands of points, and requires only a small percent of the data to generate a high-quality decision tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on three large data sets.","Fu, ZW; Golden, B; Lele, S; Raghavan, S; Wasil, E",Tactical,10.1287/opre.51.6.894.24919,"statistics, data analysis : data mining marketing, estimation/statistical techniques : decision trees computers/computer science, artificial; intelligence : genetic algorithms",5.0,,15,0,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses the development of a genetic algorithm for constructing a decision tree, focusing on performance measures and computational experiments, which aligns with the tactical level of decision-making that involves structured processes and targets.",wos-data mining,10,70,Genetically engineered decision trees: Population diversity produces smarter trees,2003
"We studied the problem of optimizing the performance of a DSS for chum prediction. In particular, we investigated the beneficial effect of adding the voice of customers through call center emails - i.e. textual information - to a chum-prediction system that only uses traditional marketing information. We found that adding unstructured, textual information into a conventional chum-prediction model resulted in a significant increase in predictive performance. From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to better identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted more effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Issue of enterprise financial distress represents the actual and interdisciplinary topic for the economic community. The bankrupt is thus one of the major externalities of today's modem economies, which cannot be avoided even with every effort Where there are investment opportunities, there are individuals and businesses that are willing to assume their financial obligations and the resulting risks to maintain and develop their standard of living or their economic activities. The decision tree algorithm is one of the most intuitive methods of data mining which can be used for financial distress prediction. Systematization literary sources and approaches prove that decision trees represent the part of the innovations in financial management. The main propose of the research is a possibility of application of a decision free algorithm for the creation of the prediction model which can be used in economy practice. Paper main aim is to create a comprehensive prediction model of enterprise financial distress based on decision trees, under the conditions of emerging markets. Paper methods are based on the decision tree, with emphasis on algorithm CART. Emerging markets included 17 countries: Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Poland Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus. Montenegro and Macedonia. Paper research is focused on the possibilities of implementation of decision tree algorithm for creation of prediction model in the condition of emerging markets. Used data contained 2,359,731 enterprises from emerging markets (30% of total amount); divided into prosperous enterprises (1,802,027) and non-prosperous enterprises (557,704); obtained from Amadeus database. Input variables for model represented 24 financial indicators, 3 dummy variables and countries GDP data, in the years 2015 and 2016. The 80% of enterprises represented training sample and 20% test sample, for model creation. The model correctly classified 93.2% of enterprises from both the training and test sample. Correctly classification of non-prosperous enterprises was 83.5% in both samples. The result of the research brings the new model for identification of bankrupt of enterprises.

"Web design in tourism organizations has become one of the key factors in maintaining a successful travel business. With questions of sustainability plaguing travel agencies, questions on how they should allocate their limited resources for website development to meet changing consumer needs while producing an effective and efficient website linger. This study provides a new technique and tool, decision trees and Weka, that identifies critical attributes that influence quality levels of a customer's experience when visiting a travel agency's website. The exploratory study derived eight evaluation attributes based on the attention, interest, desire, and action model. The study generated decision trees via Weka, a data-mining open-source software platform, to analyze the datasets from a web-based experiment. Results indicate that information quality is the most important attribute in designing the website of a travel agency. Then, attributes that enhance the simplicity of websites, such as ease of use, personalization, and flexible reservations, are considered by the customer when evaluating the website quality. Attractiveness can only contribute to evaluations of a website's quality after usefulness and website simplicity have been determined. Keeping the website useful, simple, and attractivein that orderwill give managers of travel agencies the guidance to design their websites and improve company performance.

"How to increase competitiveness of SMEs? How to improve Internet marketing strategy? Which competencies of employees are the most important for the long term company growth? How to educate the employees? How to improve information and communication (ICT) using? The answers to these questions are examined in this article. In the last fifteen years the small and medium-sized companies have been searched by qualitative research. There have been defined seven main competencies which are connected with using ICT. The ICT competencies refer to a firm capacity to deploy their material and intangible resources, usually in combination with skills, to reach desired goals. These competencies have been associated with economic results and also with the companies' web presentation. To solve this task, the authors used various data mining methods and web mining methods. The authors employed decision tree classifiers and association rules as well as class outlier detection methods and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main goal of this contribution is to explore the correspondence between ICT competencies of SME, their web presentation, long term growth and to characterize a successful company. This can help an organization to improve employee's education and to develop all the competencies which are necessary for the successful implementation of ICT. During the long term research the data have been collected within thirty enterprises using multiple interviews. Some companies had developed significantly more ICT competencies than the others and these competencies help them to be more successful and competitive.","Antlová, K; Popelínsky, L; Tandler, J",Strategic,,information and communication strategy; small and medium-sized companies; data mining; web mining; marketing intelligence; competencies,5.0,,10,0,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,"The abstract discusses long-term growth, employee competencies, and strategic use of ICT in SMEs, aligning with defining the goals and nature of an organization.",wos-data mining,70,15,LONG TERM GROWTH OF SME FROM THE VIEW OF ICT COMPETENCIES AND WEB PRESENTATIONS,2011
"In this paper various ensemble learning methods from machine learning and statistics are considered and applied to the customer choice modeling problem. The application of ensemble learning usually improves the prediction quality of flexible models like decision trees and thus leads to improved predictions. We give experimental results for two real-life marketing datasets using decision trees, ensemble versions of decision trees and the logistic regression model, which is a standard approach for this problem. The ensemble models are found to improve upon individual decision trees and outperform logistic regression. Next, an additive decomposition of the prediction error of a model is considered known as the bias/variance decomposition. A model with a high bias lacks the flexibility to fit the data well. A high variance indicates that a model is instable with respect to different datasets. Decision trees have a high variance component and a low bias component in the prediction error, whereas logistic regression has a high bias component and a low variance component. It is shown that ensemble methods aim at minimizing the variance component in the prediction error while leaving the bias component unaltered. Bias/variance decompositions for all models for both customer choice datasets are given to illustrate these concepts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Although highly relevant for marketing practice, few studies provide conceptual and empirical insights into customer portfolio management. Furthermore, most approaches to analyzing customer portfolios are static. This article discusses three neglected key issues relevant for a dynamic customer portfolio analysis: (1) Does a static versus a dynamic valuation lead to a different prioritization of customer segments in a portfolio? (2) How does offensive or defensive management of segment dynamics affect portfolio value? and (3) Do reliable predictors for dynamics of a customer's position in the portfolio exist? As a tool for customer portfolio analysis, the authors develop a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model. They capture customer dynamics by analyzing how customers switch between segments of different values across time. The authors apply their tool with longitudinal data from four firms with up to 300,000 customers. The results from the empirical analysis and a simulation study provide answers to the three key issues raised. First, compared with a dynamic analysis, a static approach overestimates the value of some customer segments but underestimates others. Second, a defensive versus offensive management of value dynamics is relatively more appropriate for middle-tier segments, whereas the opposite holds true for bottom-tier segments. Third, general customer characteristics and aggregated transaction characteristics indicate future segment dynamics, whereas specific product usage data differentiate customers according to current value.","Homburg, C; Steiner, VV; Totzek, D",Tactical,10.1509/jmkg.73.5.70,customer portfolio management; customer segment value; Markov model; customer relationship management; data mining,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the development of a segment-based customer-lifetime-value model and how to manage customer portfolios dynamically.

"With the rapid development of Web 2.0 applications, social media have increasingly become a major factor influencing the purchase decisions of customers. Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.

"Consumers are increasingly relying on other consumers' online reviews of features and quality of products while making their purchase decisions. However, the rapid growth of online consumer product reviews makes browsing a large number of reviews and identifying information of interest time consuming and cognitively demanding. Although there has been extensive research on text review mining to address this information overload problem in the past decade, the majority of existing research mainly focuses on the quality of reviews and the impact of reviews on sales and marketing. Relatively little emphasis has been placed on mining reviews to meet personal needs of individual consumers. As an essential first step toward achieving this goal, this study proposes a product feature-oriented approach to the analysis of online consumer product reviews in order to support feature-based inquiries and summaries of consumer reviews. The proposed method combines LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and a synonym lexicon to extract product features from online consumer product reviews.

"Traditional approaches to managing customer churn have typically concentrated on those customers most likely to defect. While accurately predicting customer churn probability is important, this metric alone does not sufficiently empower managers to make optimal decisions. Hence, the current study focuses on the relationship between retention incentives and profit maximisation. Specifically, we improve existing churn management practices by: (1) allowing for customer heterogeneity in incentive redemption behaviour, (2) introducing the dependence of the probability of accepting an incentive on its monetary value, and (3) offering an improved model for developing retention campaigns.

"While data mining is well established in practice, opinion mining is still in its infancy, with issues in particular around the development of methodologies which effectively extract accurate, reliable, influential and useful information from the raw opinion data collected from informal product reviews. Current approaches adopt a single-variable approach, focusing on individual metrics-word length, the presence of keywords, or the overall semantic orientation of terms within the data-while neglecting to evaluate whether these individual artifacts are indicative of the tone of a given review. This approach has significant limitations when we move from trying to merely evaluate whether an online opinion is positive or negative, to trying to evaluate how likely it is that the opinion will influence others. Given this issue, one promising avenue would be to evaluate the general analysis approaches utilized by opinion mining algorithms and identified in the literature in terms of how accurately they reflect how people actually interpret and are influenced by electronic online reviews. Through interviewing and a follow up survey of 136 participants, the validity of the approach in terms of ascertaining the tone of a piece of text can be evaluated, as well as the identification of measurable factors within text which make a given opinionated text more or less influential in an online context, further facilitating the development of more effective multivariate opinion mining approaches. Furthermore, the identification of factors which make an online opinion text more or less persuasive helps to facilitate the development of opinion mining approaches which can evaluate how likely a review is to affect an individual's decision making.","Robinson, R; Goh, TT; Zhang, R",Tactical,10.1007/s10660-012-9095-7,Electronic word of mouth communication (eWOM); Online product review; Opinion mining; Consumer decision making,5.0,,25,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of methodologies for opinion mining and the identification of factors that make online opinions more influential, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured approaches and targets in marketing analytics.",wos-data mining,10,60,Textual factors in online product reviews: a foundation for a more influential approach to opinion mining,2012
"The telecommunication company functioned in the market with extremely high competitiveness. Attracting new customers needs 5-10 times more expenses than maintaining an existing one. As a result, effective customer churn management and analysis of the reasons for customer churn are vital tasks for telecommunication operators. As a result, predicting subscriber churn by switching on the competitors becomes very important. Data Science and machine learning create enormous opportunities for solving this task to evaluate customer satisfaction with company services, determine factors that cause disappointment, and forecast which clients are at a greater risk of abandoning and changing services suppliers. A company that implements data analysis and modelling to develop customer churn prediction models has an opportunity to improve customer churn management and increase business results. The purposes of the research are the application of machine learning models for a telecommunications company, in particular, the construction of models for predicting the user churn rate and proving that Data Science models and machine learning are high-quality and effective tools for solving the tasks of forecasting the key marketing metrics of a telecommunications company. Based on the example of Telco, the article contains the results of the implementation of various models for classification, such as logistic regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, using Python programming language. All models are characterised by high quality (the general accuracy is over 80%). So, the paper demonstrates the feasibility and possibility of implementing the model to classify customers in the future to anticipate subscriber churn (clients who may abandon the company's services) and minimise consumer outflow based on this. The main factors influencing customer churn are established, which is basic information for further forecasting client outflow. Customer outflow prediction models implementation will help to reduce customer churn and maintain their loyalty. The research results can be useful for optimising marketing activity of managing the outflow of consumers of companies on the telecommunication market by developing effective decisions based on data and improving the mathematical methodology of forecasting the outflow of consumers. Therefore, the study's main theoretical and practical achievements are to develop an efficient forecasting tool for enterprises to control outflow risks and to enrich the research on data analysis and Data Science methodology to identify essential factors that determine the propensity of customers to churn.","Zatonatska, T; Fareniuk, Y; Shpyrko, V",Tactical,10.21272/mmi.2023.2-15,churn; client; consumer; Data Science; forecasting; machine learning; marketing; modelling; outflow,5.0,,15,0,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY","The abstract discusses the application of machine learning models for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications context, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at achieving specific targets such as improving customer retention and optimizing marketing activities.",wos-data science,10,70,CHURN RATE MODELING FOR TELECOMMUNICATION OPERATORS USING DATA SCIENCE METHODS,2023
"This study provides a formal analysis of the customer targeting problem when the cost for a marketing action depends on the customer response and proposes a framework to estimate the decision variables for campaign profit optimization. Targeting a customer is profitable if the impact and associated profit of the marketing treatment are higher than its cost. Despite the growing literature on uplift models to iden-tify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has investigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at the time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are conditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting campaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response probability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or customer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly estimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods for causal inference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achieves competitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. All codes are available at https://github.com/Humboldt- WI/response- dependent-costs .

"This paper proposes an elegant way of estimating retail productivity through a mathematical model inspired by FGLS multivariate linear regression, using the error equation obtained as a hidden variable estimator to be used as inferred efficiency. This methodology was applied to a dataset obtained from a leading ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) manufacturer and demonstrated substantial results. Unlike conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, the proposed approach offers benchmarking information relative to the best-performing retailers, as opposed to the typical relative-to-average outcomes of regressions. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA), this methodology relies on the entire dataset to establish the efficiency index, thereby addressing limitations imposed by DEA and allowing for executive discretion and flexibility in the analysis.","Fix, R; Pecora, JE; da Veiga, CP",Tactical,10.7769/gesec.v14i8.2496,Marketing Channels; Retail Productivity; Data Science; Feasible Generalized Least Squares,5.0,,15,5,SINDICATO SECRETARIAS ESTADO SAO PAULO,"The paper discusses a methodology for estimating retail productivity that is practical and structured, focusing on the application of a mathematical model to inform decision-making in retail contexts.

"Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. Whereas these tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, we reframe them as an explicit trade-off between the opportunity cost of the test (where some customers receive a suboptimal treatment) and the potential losses associated with deploying a suboptimal treatment to the remainder of the population. We derive a closed-form expression for the profit-maximizing test size and show that it is substantially smaller than typically recommended for a hypothesis test, particularly when the response is noisy or when the total population is small. The common practice of using small holdout groups can be rationalized by asymmetric priors. The proposed test design achieves nearly the same expected regret as the flexible yet harder-to-implement multi-armed bandit under a wide range of conditions. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in three different marketing contexts-website design, display advertising, and catalog tests-in which we estimate priors from past data. In all three cases, the optimal sample sizes are substantially smaller than for a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in higher profit.","Feit, EM; Berman, R",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2019.1194,A/B testing; randomized controlled trial; marketing experiments; Bayesian decision theory; sample size,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a method for optimizing A/B testing in marketing, focusing on the practical implementation of testing strategies and sample sizes to maximize profits.

"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the winning model before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the legwork of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e. g., the back-and-forth migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e. g., the inclusion of an off state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general recipe for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework).","Schwartz, EM; Bradlow, ET; Fader, PS",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,model selection; machine learning; data science; business intelligence; hidden Markov models; classification tree; random forest; posterior predictive model checking; hierarchical Bayesian methods; forecasting,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses decision-making tools for selecting statistical models based on data characteristics, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and forecasting.",wos-data science,10,70,Model Selection Using Database Characteristics: Developing a Classification Tree for Longitudinal Incidence Data,2014
"Targeted digital advertising (TDA) is immensely popular among marketing practitioners; investigating its effects is increasingly becoming a subject of academic research. Brands can push advertisements of the same product from different sources to consumers in a targeted manner; however, the differences in the impact on consumers of TDA with different content sources are surprisingly understudied. Therefore, this study analyzes the consumers' purchase intentions in the context of TDA with different content sources (stars vs. bloggers vs. top e-commerce streamers), and the perceived differences between consumers with different thinking styles. Through two experimental studies, this study finds that TDA with top e-commerce streamers' recommendation source can better improve consumers' purchase intentions more than TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with a blogger evaluation. For consumers who prefer the rational thinking style, TDA with a star endorsement and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better; For consumers who prefer the empirical thinking style, TDA recommended by bloggers and TDA with top e-commerce streamers recommendation can be better. Furthermore, this study finds that consumers' mental simulation and perceived usefulness can mediate the relationships described above, and that the two play a chain mediation role. The findings contribute to the precision marketing literature by enriching the understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying consumers' perceptions of and decision factors toward the TDA.","Han, Z; Du, G",Tactical,10.1002/cb.2230,,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The study analyzes consumer purchase intentions based on different targeted digital advertising strategies, which aligns with tactical decisions such as campaign automation and advanced targeting.

"Loyal patients can bring substantial benefits to a hospital. Service quality of a hospital was one of the driving forces to patients' satisfaction and loyalty, but it was a necessary but not a sufficient factor. Recent studies in consumer behavior had proven that the perceived value was the primary determinant of loyal behavior for services. This research focused on identifying the patients' perceived values toward hospitals. To capture with more confidence the misty inner of the patients' value perception, this study adopted the fuzzy logic, a method that had been develop to reflect the fuzzy nature of human mind. Being the first in adopting a fuzzy logic in this context, this research find quality of care and physician competence were the top two value aspects perceived by patients. This was consistent with previous studies, yet some new insights were further revealed. This study used a closeness index to distinguish the best hospital that was otherwise assessed by other methods as similar to the rivalries. Results also indicated that the hospital with superior operation performance was the one received better levels of patients' perceived value.

"House Of Quality (HOQ) is one of the matrices of an iterative process called Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The foundation of the HOQ is the belief that products should be designed to reflect customers' desires and taste. HOQ is performed by a multidisciplinary team representing marketing, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and any other functions considered critical by the company. In general, it provides a framework in which all participants can communicate their thoughts about a product. More specifically, HOQ is often used to identify the relationships between requirements based on different viewpoints. There are two issues in analyzing these requirements using HOQ. First, requirements are often described informally using vague terms. However, lack of formal way in interpreting the semantics of these requirements makes it difficult to determine if a realization of the system meets its customer's needs. Second, identifying relationships between requirements is often time consuming. Sometimes, it is difficult to arrive at a group consensus on a particular relationship between requirements. To address these issues, we have developed a fuzzy logic-based extension to HOQ for capturing imprecise requirements to both facilitate communication of team members and have a formal representation of requirements. Based on this representation, we developed a heuristic inference scheme to reason about the implicit relationships between requirements. We illustrate our approach using a textile mill supply business application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Supplier segmentation means that the suppliers of a specific firm are categorized on the basis of their similarities. This supply-side business-to-business (B2B) segmentation is of special importance to companies with many suppliers. Supplier segmentation yields a manageable number of segments, each of which requires a separate strategy. Standard supplier segmentation methods have serious shortcomings, for instance because they fail to make a proper connection between supplier segmentation and other supplier-related activities such as supplier selection and development. Moreover, these standard methods typically use a limited number of segmentation criteria and different sets of criteria are suggested for each method. It is unclear for practitioners how to choose a particular method. The purpose of this paper is to form a practical tool for supplier segmentation taking into account all suggested segmentation criteria. The principal result of this paper is the design of a rule-based method to segment the suppliers of a firm based on two overarching dimensions: supplier capabilities and supplier willingness. The method is applied to a real-world situation to show how the results can be used in practice. A general sensitivity analysis procedure for fuzzy rule-based systems is proposed and then implemented, to identify the most important supplier capabilities and willingness criteria and to formulate better supplier development strategies. A major conclusion of the paper is that the fuzzy logic approach to supplier segmentation is simple to apply in practice, yet considers all available segmentation criteria and their inherent fuzziness in a way that is easily adaptable to a specific industrial context.

"The article deals with the issue of a client's creditworthiness assessment in the insurance industry. The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification ofnew factors which have relation to a client's creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client's creditworthiness as fuzzy variables.

"PurposeAmidst unpredictable and turbulent periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, service organization's responses are required to be innovative, adaptable and resilient. The purpose of this study is to explore the utilization of both reconfiguration and transformational strategies as instruments for cultivating resilience and advancing sustainability in service organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe study examines a proposed resilience model using fuzzy logic. The research also used a semantic differential scale to capture nuanced and intricate attitudes. Finally, to augment the validity of the resilience model, a measurement scale was formulated using business mathematics and expert opinions.FindingsAlthough investing in resilience training can help organizations gain control and maintain their operations in times of crisis, it may not directly help service organizations understand the external turmoil, seek available resources or create adaptive remedies. Conversely, high levels of reconfiguration and transformation management vigour empower a service organization's revolutionary, malleable vision, organizational structure and decision-making processes, welcoming talented and innovative employees to enhance capabilities during crises.Research limitations/implicationsThe resilience model bestows a comprehensive understanding of the pertinence of building resilience for service organizations identifying the antecedents that influence the adoption of these strategies and introduces a range of theoretical perspectives that empowers service organizations to conceptualize and plan for building resilience.

"Market segmentation is essential to target efficaciously core-segment customers and to obtain a competitive advantage. Firms when confronted by the range of market segments, have difficulty in deciding the core-segment customers who are the most probable purchasers of their product and services. We propose a novel fuzzy group multi-criteria method for market entry and segment evaluation and selection. This proposed method provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with real option analysis (ROA) and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory. The contribution of the proposed segment evaluation and selection method is fivefold: (1) it addresses the gaps in the marketing literature on the efficacious and effective assessment of market segments; (2) it provides a comprehensive and systematic framework that combines bi-level multi-objective optimization with ROA and fuzzy cooperative n-person game theory; (3) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; (4) it does not insist on consensus but synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative judgments and quantitative data; and (5) it is applicable to national and international market segmentation.

"Identifying an optimal positioning strategy for new products is a critical and difficult strategic decision. In this research, we develop a genetic algorithm based procedure called GA SEARCH that identifies optimal new product positions. In two simulation comparisons and an empirical study, we compare the results from GA SEARCH to those obtained from the best currently available algorithm (PRODSRCH). We find that GA SEARCH performs better regardless of the number of ideal points, existing products, number of attributes or choice set size. Furthermore, GA SEARCH can account for choice set size heterogeneity. Results show that GA SEARCH outperformed the best current algorithm when choice set size varied at the individual level, an important source of consumer heterogeneity that has been ignored in current algorithms formulated to solve this optimization problem.

"User-generated content (UGC) is influential in reducing customer perceived risk and determining online store sales. E-sellers spend huge costs and efforts to improve UGC for it serves as a convenient and persuasive alternative for marketing and advertising purposes. Considering that consumers may set lower and/or upper limits (i.e., psychological thresholds) in which the good is expected to be, and purchase decisions are considered as a multi-stage decision process, yet models in previous research cannot uncover this decision-making process. Therefore, exploring the impact of UGC at each decision-making stage and detecting the psychological thresholds on various aspects of UGC (i.e., the fine-grained effects of UGC) contribute to optimizing the UGC with the best cost to boost sales. To this end, a fine-grained joint two-stage decision model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB-P) model is proposed to support economical UGC marketing. Specifically, we compile a factors system composed of various types of aggregate-level statistics of UGC, which can impact risk perception. Afterward, change point analysis is used to find multi-level consumer psychological thresholds on UGC factors and consumers' risk perception model is constructed to measure purchasing probabilities in the first decision-making stage. On the basis of consumers' risk perception model, the ZINB-P model is built to fully capture the fine-grained effects of UGC factors on each stage of the consumer purchase decision. It integrates two stages of consumer decision: the consumer risk perception and non-compensatory choice in the first stage, and the second compensatory stage. A genetic algorithm is constructed to jointly estimate the parameters in ZINB-P model. Finally, an experiment on a kind of fresh produce from Taobao.com evidences the precision of our model. We demonstrate how our model can provide with economical UGC marketing strategies using a decision support table, in which some scenarios are identified. E-sellers can use this table to find the scenarios they are located in and identify the critical UGC factors that impede the sales in each scenario, and thus economical UGC marketing strategies can be obtained by improving these critical UGC factors.","Li, SG; Zhang, YQ; Yu, ZX; Liu, F",Tactical,10.1007/s10660-020-09401-8,Perceived risk; Purchase decision process; Psychological threshold; Fine-grained joint model; ZINB-P model,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a model for optimizing user-generated content (UGC) to enhance sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Accounting for social network effects in marketing strategies has become an important issue. Taking a step back, we seek to incorporate and analyze social network effects on new product development and then propose a model to engineer product diffusion over a social network. We build upon the share-of-choice (SOC) problem, which is a strategic combinatorial optimization problem used commonly as one of the methods to analyze conjoint analysis data by marketers in order to identify a product with largest market share, and show how to incorporate social network effects in the SOC problem. We construct a genetic algorithm to solve this computationally challenging (NP-Hard) problem and show that ignoring social network effects in the design phase results in a significantly lower market share for a product. In this setting, we introduce the secondary operational problem of determining the least expensive way of influencing individuals and strengthening product diffusion over a social network. This secondary problem is of independent interest, as it addresses contagion models and the issue of intervening in diffusion over a social network, which are of significant interest in marketing and epidemiological settings.","Gunnec, D; Raghavan, S",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12246,Genetic Algorithm; Marketing; Optimization; Peer Influence; Product Design; Social Networks,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the incorporation of social network effects in marketing strategies and product diffusion, focusing on product development and operational methods to enhance market share.

"Many real life ill-structured problems involve high uncertainty and complexity preventing application of analytical optimization techniques in building effective decision support systems (DSS). These systems may employ simulation method and search for a good solution through what-if analysis. However, this method is very time consuming and often overlooks the consideration of many promising alternative solutions. A genetic algorithm (GA) automates the search for good solutions by finding near-optimal solutions and increases effectiveness of DSS. This paper introduces a hybrid method based on the combination of Monte-Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms. The combined method is illustrated through application to the marketing mix problem to improve the process for searching and evaluating alternatives for decisional support. The paper compares two methods: MC and MC + GA. It also discusses ways for dealing with crisp and soft constraints contained in the example problem. A business game environment is chosen for experiments. The results of the experiments show that the GA-based approach outperforms human what-if method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

"Content platforms (e.g., newspapers, magazines) post several stories daily on their dedicated social media pages and promote some of them using targeted content advertising (TCA). Posting stories enables content platforms to grow their social media audiences and generate digital advertising revenue from the impressions channeled through social media posts' link clicks. However, optimal scheduling of social media posts and TCA is formidable, requiring content platforms to determine what to post; when to post; and whether, when, and how much to spend on TCA to maximize profits. Social media managers lament this complexity, and academic literature offers little guidance. Consequently, the authors draw from literature on circadian rhythms in information processing capabilities to build a novel theoretical framework on social media content scheduling and explain how scheduling attributes (i.e., time of day, content type, and TCA) affect the link clicks metric. They test their hypotheses using a model estimated on 366 days of Facebook post data from a top 50 U.S. newspaper. Subsequently, they build an algorithm that allows social media managers to optimally plan social media content schedules and maximize gross profits. Applying the algorithm to a holdout sample, the authors demonstrate a potential increase in gross profits by at least 8%.","Kanuri, VK; Chen, YX; Sridhar, S",Tactical,10.1177/0022242918805411,circadian rhythms; content strategy; decision support system; genetic algorithm; social media,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the optimization of social media content scheduling and targeted content advertising, which involves interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"Marketing channel choices in agricultural trade networks affect the networks' overall performance and influence rural livelihoods. This study identifies key determinants of these choices among natural rubber traders in Indonesia to evaluate four policy scenarios and their potential effects on rural incomes. Since traders' marketing decisions are based on past interactions, resulting trade networks are formed in recursive processes and can be understood as complex adaptive systems. Due to inherent endogeneity in these systems, process-based approaches such as agent-based modelling (ABM) can be effective in understanding them. Using a self-gathered primary dataset from Jambi Province, Indonesia, we implement and parameterise an ABM to simulate the formation of the rubber trading network and analyse the effects on rural livelihoods of four hypothetical policy scenarios: improved micro-credit availability, increased access to education, better infrastructure and transportation capacity, and market information availability. The model is calibrated through a genetic algorithm which maximises the similarity between the simulated network and the actual network observed in the data. Results indicate that sellers' decisions on a buyer are primarily determined by debt obligations and past peer-interactions. The most influential sellers have a similar level of formal education as their peers and live in close physical proximity. Results of the policy scenario analysis suggests that policies aimed at reducing sellers' dependence on credit from buyers and increasing education are the most effective policies for improving value chains and reducing poverty in the region under consideration.

"This paper discusses how a manufacturer and its retailers interact with each other to optimize their product marketing strategies, platform product configuration and inventory policies in a VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) supply chain. The manufacturer procures raw materials from multiple suppliers to produce a family of products sold to multiple retailers. Multiple types of products are substitutable each other to end customers. The manufacturer makes its decision on raw materials' procurement, platform product configuration, product replenishment policies to retailers with VMI, price discount rate, and advertising investment to maximize its profit. Retailers in turn consider the optimal local advertising investments and retail prices to maximize their profits. This problem is modeled as a dual simultaneous non-cooperative game (as a dual Nash game) model with two sub-games. One is between the retailers serving in competing retail markets and the other is between the manufacturer and the retailers. This paper combines analytical, iterative and GA (genetic algorithm) methods to develop a game solution algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium.

"Cluster-based segmentation usually involves two sets of variables: (i) the needs-based variables (referred to as the bases variables), which are used in developing the original segments to identify the value, and (ii) the classification or background variables, which are used to profile or target the customers. The managers goal is to utilize these two sets of variables in the most efficient manner. Pragmatic managerial interests recognize the underlying need to start shifting from methodologies that obtain highly precise value-based segments but may be of limited practical use as they provide less targetable segments. Consequently, the imperative is to shift toward newer segmentation approaches that provide greater focus on targetable segments while maintaining homogeneity. This requires dual objective segmentation, which is a combinatorially difficult problem. Hence, we propose and examine a new evolutionary methodology based on genetic algorithms to address this problem. We show, based on a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation and a case study, that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods for a wide variety of problem instances. We are able to obtain statistically significant and managerially important improvements in targetability with little diminution in the identifiability of value-based segments. Moreover, the proposed methodology provides a set of good solutions, unlike existing methodologies that provide a single solution. We also show how these good solutions can be used to plot an efficient Pareto frontier. Finally, we present useful insights that would help managers in implementing the proposed solution approach effectively.","Balakrishnan, PV; Kumar, S; Han, P",Tactical,10.1111/j.1540-5915.2011.00333.x,Cluster Analysis; Dual Objective; Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid Heuristics; Marketing; Pareto-Frontier; and Segmentation,5.0,,5,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses methodologies for segmenting customers based on needs and targeting, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"In addition to retailing new vehicles, automotive manufacturers in the United States sell millions of vehicles through leasing and to fleet customers every year. The majority of these vehicles are returned to the automotive manufacturers at the end of the contracted term and must be remarketed. In 2007, about 10 million used vehicles were sold at more than 400 auctions in the United States. Large consigners face decisions every day about when, where, and at what price to offer these vehicles, which has significant financial implications for their profitability. To address the challenges of the distribution process, Power Information Network (PIN), a division of J.D. Power and Associates, developed the PIN Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles System (ODAV), an automated decision optimization system that helps remarketers maximize profits through the most advantageous distribution of their auction vehicles. At the core of the system is a combination of three models that determine the distribution of the vehicles on a daily basis: a nearest neighbor linear regression model for short-term auction price forecasting; an autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis model for volume-price elasticity; and a genetic algorithm optimizer for vehicle distribution. Since its launch in 2003, PIN has been providing ODAV services on a daily basis, and to date, more than two million vehicles have been distributed through this system.

"The motion picture industry is characterized by a dynamic market environment, limited shelf space and product category management, and consequently, complex channel contracts specifying the split of box office revenue between distributors and exhibitors. Although such a contracting practice creates a considerable administrative effort and channel conflict, it is not clear whether such complexity is necessary for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision support system, SilverScreener, to capture strategic behaviors of channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler two-part tariff or 50/50 split contracts perform as well as the current contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts.

It also aims to propose new-normal market entry strategies to address the uncertainty as a result of COVID-19's implications and provide for lack of knowledge and information in an uncertain business environment by way of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem for pharmaceutical market entry. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty facet within transaction-cost analysis consideration and utilise a descriptive three-case study approach taking in Johnson and Johnson (J&J), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis to present an ADO (Antecedent-Decisions-Outcomes) understanding of their usual market entry approach, the approach undertaken during the pandemic and the outcomes thereafter facilitating new-normal uncertainty considerations to factor in. Further with this insight, we develop a conceptual framework addressing the transaction-cost analysis implications of uncertainties toward lack of knowledge and information for a new-normal market entry approach and operating strategy for pharmaceuticals applicable due to IoT (Internet of Things). Findings Uncertainty (external and internal) is different now in the new-normal business environment for pharmaceuticals and boils down to acute shortage of knowledge and information impact to make an appropriately informed decision. Therefore, considering the changed factors to consider, pharmaceuticals need to be able to undertake market entry with vaccines and medicines by way of IoT thereby enabling, the filling of the gap via real-time data access and sharing, including enhancing predictive analysis for sustenance.

Using 15 prefecture-level cities in China as a case study, this paper gathers and organizes relevant data indicators of rural economy and agricultural ecological environment economic recovery for the period between 2008 and 2020, builds the composite evaluation index, determines the development index using the reporting system function, and finally employs a novel digital evaluation scheme to assess the coupling and coordination between the cities over time. The following inferences are made. To begin, linear growth with uneven regional development may be seen in the rural economy's complete level index (values from 0.422 to 0.622). The objective of the study is to address the two-stage collaborative planning challenge to maximize farmer income by promoting the economic recovery. This article offers a mixed-integer processing paradigm to account for these restrictions. Calculations show that the suggested collaborative planning model may increase farmers' distributing revenue by 7.98% compared to the existing independent decision-making distribution channel. Management thoughts have been developed based on various decision scenarios. Agricultural producers must sort and bundle their products with care and work with a fast and reliable delivery business and on time to deliver their items. Furthermore, the approach can assess the influence of distribution routes on producers' revenues.","Zhai, T; Liu, JB; Wang, DQ",Tactical,10.1007/s10644-023-09495-8,Path optimization; Industrial chain; Agriculture marketing; Internet of Things,0.0,,20,5,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a specific approach to optimizing the distribution of fresh food, focusing on maximizing farmer income through collaborative planning and evaluation of distribution routes.
