A SURVEY OF THE COMPARISON SHOPPING AGENT-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,"Pathak, B",2010,,"The web-based comparison shopping agents (CSAs) or shopbots have emerged as important business intermediaries that provide decision support to both the shoppers and the merchants. The basic idea is to provide an easy access to both the price and non-price based competitive features to shoppers. The CSAs do not have an equivalent counterpart in the offline world and they have generated a significant amount of interest among researchers in economics, marketing, and information systems fields. There have been numerous studies on the CSAs in the contexts of price dispersion, consumer behavior, search costs, and recommender systems. The focus of this paper is to study the contemporary literature about the CSAs to analyze them in the context of decision support systems (DSS). In order to provide comprehensive decision support, a typical DSS should have four components: data, models, interfaces, and user specific customization. In this paper, this four component framework is used to synthesize the current research work in the context of DSS and to explore contemporary CSAs. The paper provides suggestions for improving the decision support aspect of the CSAs and proposes a research agenda for the CSA-based decision support systems.",comparison shopping agents; CSA; shopbots; comparison shopping; decision support systems,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,wos-recommendation,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the role of comparison shopping agents (CSAs) as decision support systems (DSS) and explores their contemporary literature, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and planning in the context of marketing and consumer behavior.",60,20,10,5,5
Seeing eye to eye: social augmented reality and shared decision making in the marketplace,"Hilken, T; Keeling, DI; de Ruyter, K; Mahr, D; Chylinski, M",2020,10.1007/s11747-019-00688-0,"Firms increasingly seek to improve the online shopping experience by enabling customers to exchange product recommendations through social augmented reality (AR). We utilize socially situated cognition theory and conduct a series of five studies to explore how social AR supports shared decision making in recommender-decision maker dyads. We demonstrate that optimal configurations of social AR, that is, a static (vs. dynamic) point-of-view sharing format matched with an image-enhanced (vs. text-only) communicative act, increase recommenders' comfort with providing advice and decision makers' likelihood of using the advice in their choice. For both, these effects are due to a sense of social empowerment, which also stimulates recommenders' desire for a product and positive behavioral intentions. However, recommenders' communication motives impose boundary conditions. When recommenders have strong impression management concerns, this weakens the effect of social empowerment on recommendation comfort. Furthermore, the stronger a recommender's persuasion goal, the less likely the decision maker is to use the recommendation in their choice.",Social augmented reality; Online shopping; Shared decision making; Customer-to-customer communication; Socially situated cognition,SPRINGER,wos-recommendation,Operational,"The abstract discusses how social augmented reality (AR) enhances online shopping experiences through consumer recommendations, which falls under managing daily activities and consumer interactions.

The Importance of Modeling Temporal Dependence of Timing and Quantity in Direct Marketing,"Jen, LC; Chou, CH; Allenby, GM",2009,10.1509/jmkr.46.4.482,"The analysis of customer value in direct marketing typically combines customer timing and quantity data into a single statistic that is used to compute lifetime values, rank-order customers for differential action, and identify prospects for cross-selling. However, current models assume that purchase timing and quantity decisions are independently realized (i.e., uncorrelated) over time given individual-level parameters. In this article, the authors show that customer value calculations can be severely biased in these models when timing and quantity are dependently related. The authors propose alternative models that lead to substantial gains in profitability in two direct-marketing data sets. The results indicate that the commonly held assumption of independence leads to an over-valuation of customer value.",customer relationship management; customer scoring; lifetime value; covariance heterogeneity; Bayesian analysis,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the analysis of customer value in direct marketing and the impact of timing and quantity decisions on customer valuations, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions and strategies.

"The role of cognitive style, gullibility, and demographics on the use of social media for financial decision making","Florendo, J; Estelami, H",2019,10.1057/s41264-019-00064-7,"Consumer use of social media has witnessed significant growth in recent years. Due to its unregulated, user-generated, and poorly censored format, social media use has blurred the line between the fake and the true and can result in mass dissemination of inaccurate and false information, thereby impacting national politics, election outcomes, and social interactions between consumer social clusters. In the unique context of financial decisions, consumer reliance on social media can significantly increase the risk of making poor financial decisions. This study examined the impact of cognitive style, consumer gullibility, and demographics on consumers' reliance on social media for financial decision making. The results of a US national survey identify consumer characteristics which contribute to increased reliance on social media in financial decision making.

Consumer decision making in online shopping environments:: The effects of interactive decision aids,"HÃ¤ubl, G; Trifts, V",2000,10.1287/mksc.19.1.4.15178,"Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aims for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives x attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making In particular, rye focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality RA the efficiency of purchase decisions-shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort, This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the effects of interactive decision aids on consumer decision making in online shopping environments, which aligns with tactical decision processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets, focusing on specific tools and methods for improving consumer engagement and purchase decisions.",10,70,15,0,5
Consumers' redemption behavior of recommended mobile coupons in social network sites,"Tang, Q; Liu, F; Liu, S; Ma, YF",2019,10.1108/MD-03-2017-0234,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the key factors that affect consumer redemption intention toward mobile coupons recommended in social network sites (SNS). Design/methodology/approach A research model that integrates recommendation trust, positive utilities, and negative utilities of coupon redemption is developed. With the important role of trust in social recommendation taken into consideration, the key drivers of recommendation trust were analyzed in the model. Data were collected from 210 users with mobile coupon recommendation experience in one of the largest SNS (i.e. WeChat) in China. The authors used partial least squares technique to analyze the model. Findings Recommendation trust and positive utilities (economic benefits and perceived enjoyment) positively affect the intention of mobile coupon redemption. Perceived risk, as a negative utility, negatively influences coupon redemption intention. In addition, swift trust (structure assurance, perceived similarity, trust propensity, and expertise of the recommender), knowledge-based trust (familiarity with the retailers), and emotion-based trust (social tie strength) are key drivers that promote recommendation trust. Originality/value While prior research investigated mobile coupon redemption behavior in which coupons were issued by merchants, limited research analyzed consumer responses toward mobile coupons in social recommendation.

Solving multiattribute design problems with analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis: An empirical comparison,"Scholl, A; Manthey, L; Helm, R; Steiner, M",2005,10.1016/j.ejor.2004.01.026,"We consider the multiattribute design problem (MADP) which contains a considerable number of alternatives, resulting from the combination of a limited number of discrete levels of several quantitative and/or qualitative attributes. In order to solve such problems, the preferences of individual decision makers have to be measured. Though a considerable number of methods is available from different research areas, only a subset is applicable to MADP. In this paper, we report on an empirical study which considered the problem of designing a university and involved more than 300 respondents. Because of this large-scale design, we performed a paper-and-pencil investigation and selected methods which could concisely be applied in such a setting: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the conjoint analysis (CA). The results show that both methods give useful models of the respondents' preferences. However, inspecting the utility functions determined in detail reveals considerable discrepancies between them. Most of the measures used for comparison indicate AHP to be the better choice for the special decision situation considered. In order to get a more general recommendation, we categorize different types of MADP and discuss the applicability of AHP and CA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Reactance to recommendations: When unsolicited advice yields contrary responses,"Fitzsimons, GJ; Lehmann, DR",2004,10.1287/mksc.1030.0033,"Recommendations often play a positive role in the decision process by reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options. However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.",recommendations; intelligent agents; decision support systems; internet marketing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation,Operational,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior and decision-making processes in response to recommendations from experts and intelligent agents, which aligns with managing day-to-day consumer interactions and preferences.",10,20,60,5,5

Consumer self-construal and trust as determinants of the reactance to a recommender advice,"Aljukhadar, M; Trifts, V; Senecal, S",2017,10.1002/mar.21017,"Commercial recommendation agents (RAs) represent an important type of the decision support systems (DSSs) that are widely used by online retailers and firms. To date, little is known about the factors that shape the user's decision making and reactance toward the recommendations of these agents. Building on theories from psychology and information systems domains, this research proposes that a user's self-construal and trust are two relevant factors that interact to shape the behavior toward the RA advice. Two studies, the first conducted using potential online customers and the second conducted at a behavioral laboratory, provided support to this proposition. The first study considered RA trust and showed that activating the interdependent self leads users with low (high) trust to exhibit high reactance behavior toward the RA advice. The second study variated trust using trust cues and corroborated the latter finding, while showing no important impact for the psychological reactance trait. As expected, in both studies the reactance behavior of independent users was not affected by trust.

The Impact of Social Networking Sites on Luxury Vehicles Purchase Decision Process in Gulf Cooperation Council Countries,"Al-Abdallah, G; Khair, N; Elmarakby, R",2021,10.1080/08961530.2020.1867023,"Social networking sites are becoming an essential part of consumer daily activities, with profound changes in purchasing behavior compared to traditional buying formats. This study investigates the possible impact of social networking sites on the purchasing decision process concerning luxury vehicles in one of the most important markets for such products, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The study also investigates the possible impact of relative demographics on the direct relationship between social networking sites (independent variable) and the purchase decision process (dependent variable) of luxury vehicles. In order to achieve this aim, a descriptive analytical methodology is utilized with quantitative survey strategy, with a five-point Likert-type questionnaire. Of 1,500 personally submitted questionnaires distributed over a non-probability quota sample to the main showrooms and dealerships in the GCC, 1,257 were retrieved (a response rate of 83.8%); after the filtration and screening process, 1,224 valid questionnaire forms were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that social networking sites have a significant positive direct impact on the purchasing decision process of luxury vehicles in the examined population, with the highest impact being for the first two stages of the process (need recognition and information search). As for the moderation effect of relative demographics, only income and time daily time spent on social media had positive significant moderating effects on the direct relationship between social networking sites and purchasing decision process, while education had a negative significant effect.

Product set granularity and consumer response to recommendations,"Tsekouras, D; Dellaert, BGC; Donkers, B; HÃ¤ubl, G",2020,10.1007/s11747-019-00682-6,"Many consumer decisions are assisted by product recommendations. When retailers provide such recommendations, there is an inherent tension between (1) presenting a set of products that are close in attractiveness (fine product set granularity) and (2) presenting a wider range of products that are more different in attractiveness (coarse product set granularity). While the former can maximize the attractiveness of the recommended set of products, the latter makes it easier for consumers to determine which of the recommended products is most attractive, thus boosting consumer response. Evidence from a large-scale field study (with naturally occurring variation in the granularity of online recommendation sets) provides strong support for this tension and shows that less fine-grained product recommendation sets promote consumer response. We also find that, in line with our theorizing, coarser set granularity increases the time consumers spend processing detailed information about individual products relative to time they spend comparing products at the set level. These effects are less pronounced when consumer engagement in the decision process is low. The key insights from the field study are replicated in a tightly controlled experiment (using a different product domain).

Competing for Recommendations: The Strategic Impact of Personalized Product Recommendations in Online Marketplaces,"Zhou, B; Zou, TX",2023,10.1287/mksc.2022.1388,"We study how an online marketplace's personalized product recommendations and its consumer profiling accuracy affect third-party sellers' competition and the market outcomes. Sellers strategically adjust prices to compete for the marketplace's recommendations. As the marketplace more accurately predicts consumers' preferences, the equilibrium price first decreases and then increases, and both the marketplace's and the sellers' profits may decrease despite the improved recommendation accuracy. Moreover, recommending the most profitable product for each recommendation may reduce profits of the marketplace and the sellers, and the marketplace can benefit from excluding pricing information in its recommendation decisions to prevent sellers' recommendation competition. Counterintuitively, regulations that bar recommendations from considering profit margin information can lead to higher prices and thus harm consumers. These results are driven by competing sellers' three distinctive incentives: competing for recommendations, exploiting targeted consumers, and undercutting rivals' prices. We also find that our key insights remain qualitatively unchanged if the marketplace recommends products based on consumer surplus, and the equilibrium price will be lower in comparison.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach Best-Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important.

How Customer Referral Programs Turn Social Capital into Economic Capital,"Van den Bulte, C; Bayer, E; Skiera, B; Schmitt, P",2018,10.1509/jmr.14.0653,"Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer-referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital.

Effects of Social and Temporal Distance on Consumers' Responses to Peer Recommendations,"Zhao, M; Xie, JH",2011,10.1509/jmkr.48.3.486,"This article examines the interplay of social and temporal distance on consumers' responses to others' recommendations. Drawing on research on psychological distance and the fit literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. Instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

It also highlights a set of criteria to aid prioritisations among prospective provenance associations that have a potential to be used as brand values of place umbrella brands. Practical implications - The paper identifies some characteristics of provenance associations, which make them more transferable across a bundle of umbrella brand partners. The generation of better marketing theory in the field of place branding will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions in choice of provenance associations. Findings - It is claimed that transcendence is related to the transferability of provenance associations across a bundle of brands.

Ads are watching me A view from the interplay between anthropomorphism and customisation,"Puzakova, M; Rocereto, JF; Kwak, H",2013,10.2501/IJA-32-4-513-538,"With the advancement of technological platforms, the use of recommendation agents that can provide highly customisable solutions has become more ubiquitous. Marketing academics and practitioners alike have begun to investigate various communication styles and functionality designs of such decision aid systems. One variant of a design of a recommendation agent is to imbue it with humanlike features (i.e. to anthropomorphise it). However, academic research is silent with respect to whether this type of design would lead to more favourable consumer evaluations. To fill this gap, our research investigates the downstream consequences of anthropomorphising a recommendation agent, when the recommendation itself may require the exchange of personally sensitive information, and the message is customised. The results of two experiments reveal that, when a message is customised, the effect of an anthropomorphised recommendation agent on attitude towards the advertisement is predominantly negative and is mediated by consumers' unwillingness to provide personal information to an anthropomorphic recommendation agent, as well as by greater psychological resistance towards the advertisement. Our research concludes with theoretical and practical implications, as well as further research directions.",,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The research focuses on the design and functionality of recommendation agents, particularly how anthropomorphism affects consumer attitudes.

Complaint or recommendation? The impact of customers' state and trait goal orientations on customer engagement behaviors,"Chen, XX; Yu, HY; Gentry, JW; Yu, F",2017,10.1002/cb.1629,"The importance of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs) has been widely acknowledged in marketing. CEB encompasses an interactive relationship with the engaged object. A customer's personality characteristics play an important role in the interactive process. So it is necessary to examine how customer's personality characteristics influence customer engagement behaviors. However, there has been relatively less empirical research examining the impact of a customer's personality characteristics on CEBs. Customer goal orientation (promotion orientation vs. prevention orientation) is one such important personality characteristic. This research examined how customer goal orientation influenced CEBs. We used a priming technique to examine the relationships between the customer's state goal orientation and the customer's recommendations and complaints in study 1. The results showed that customers with state promotion-focused goal orientations initiated more recommendations than the customers with state prevention-focused goal orientations. For complaints, the difference between these two groups was not significant. Study 2 investigated the impact of trait goal orientation on the customer's recommendations and complaints. The results showed that the trait promotion-focused goal orientation customers were more likely to initiate both recommendations and complaints behaviors than the trait prevention-focused goal orientation customers. The findings of the research demonstrate that customer goal orientation is an important influence on positive and negative CEBs, and state and trait goal orientations have different impacts on CEBs.

Analysis of an industrial component commonality problem,"Jans, R; Degraeve, Z; Schepens, L",2008,10.1016/j.ejor.2007.01.008,"We discuss a case study of an industrial production-marketing coordination problem involving component commonality. For the product line considered, the strategic goal of the company is to move from the current low volume market to a high volume market. The marketing department believes that this can be achieved by substantially lowering the end products' prices. However, this requires a product redesign to lower production costs in order to maintain profit margins. The redesign decision involves grouping end products into families. All products within one family use the same version of some components. This paper fits in the stream of recent literature on component commonality where the focus has shifted from inventory cost savings to production and development cost savings. Further, we consider both costs and revenues, leading to a profit maximization approach. The price elasticity of demand determines the relationship between the price level and number of units sold. Consequently, we integrate information from different functional areas such as production, marketing and accounting. We formulate the problem as a net-present-value investment decision. We propose a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model to find the optimal commonality decision. The recommendation based on our analysis has been implemented in the company. In addition, the application allows us to experimentally validate some claims made in the literature and obtain managerial insights into the trade-offs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the Pension Builder, and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer-online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice.

Regulatory focus and investment advisers' recommending behavior,"Ewe, SY; Lee, CKC; Gul, FA",2021,10.1108/IJBM-12-2019-0452,"Purpose This study examines the effect of a regulatory-focused prime (i.e. a brochure with a picture and message) on the recommending behavior of investment advisers in the context of an investment decision. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted with 468 participants, mostly from the financial services industry. Study 1 examined the direct effect of a regulatory-focused prime on an investment adviser's recommending behavior, whereas Study 2 examined the moderating role of regulatory fit on such behavior. Study 3 validated the findings. Findings The results provide evidence that a message using visual and textual cues based on a promotion and prevention regulatory focus may trigger a preference in an investment adviser's product recommendation. A promotion (prevention)-focused framed message will trigger the recommendation of an investment plan with a higher but riskier (safe and stable) potential return. However, when the same prime is presented with details of a performance incentive scheme, the effect of the prime is reduced when there is a regulatory nonfit between the prime and the message relating to the performance incentive scheme. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of understanding how regulatory-focused stimuli may subconsciously influence the recommendation of investment advisers as heuristics used in decision-making, thereby influencing their clients' investment decisions.

This phenomenon raises ethical concerns regarding consumer well-being, as it potentially compromises the quality of consumption decisions by reinforcing a homogeneity of information. Introducing novelty into recommendation systems is a viable strategy to counteract this issue, as the predominance of homogeneous information plays a crucial role in the formation of filter bubbles.

When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.",retargeting; online advertising; field experiments; online decision process; construal level theory,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of dynamic retargeted ads versus generic ads, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

When is more really more? The effect of brands on choice overload in adolescents,"Misuraca, R; Ceresia, F; Nixon, AE; Abbate, CS",2021,10.1108/JCM-08-2020-4021,"Purpose-Research on choice overload with adult participants has shown that the presence of a brand significantly mitigates the phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether these findings can be expanded to a population of adolescents, where it has already been shown that choice overload occurs in a similar way as adults. Design/methodology/approach-Studies 1 and 2 aim to test whether the presence of a brand name mitigates the adverse consequences of choice overload in adolescents. In line with prior research on choice overload, in both studies, the authors compared between-subjects differences in the levels of reported dissatisfaction, difficulty and regret in a choice condition where adolescents chose among either 6 or 24 options associated with brand names and in another choice condition where adolescents chose among the same 6 or 24 options but not associated with brand names. Findings-This paper presents evidence from two studies that when facing either a large or a small amount of choice options that are associated with brand names, choice overload disappears among adolescents. Conversely, when no brands are associated to the choice options, adolescents report choice overload, that is a greater dissatisfaction, difficulties and regret with larger (versus smaller) assortments. Practical implications-Prior research on choice overload has led to recommendations that marketers and other choice architects should simply reduce choice options or assortments to improve consumers' satisfaction. However, our finding suggests that this recommendation may be invalidated when brands are present, at least for certain age groups. Adolescents cope indeed very well with large assortments of branded products. Originality/value-The research adds to the existing understanding of choice overload, demonstrating that the brand is a moderator of the phenomenon for adolescents, who currently represent a large portion of the market. A second important contribution of this work is that it extends prior research on choice overload to real-world consumer scenarios, where consumers choose among products with a brand, rather than among products described only by technical characteristics or nutritional values, as in classical studies on choice overload.",Brands; Adolescents; Decision-making; Choice overload,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The study investigates the effects of brand presence on choice overload among adolescents, which has implications for marketing strategies and consumer behavior in a structured manner.",10,70,15,0,5
How Political Identity Shapes Customer Satisfaction,"Fernandes, D; Ordabayeva, N; Han, K; Jung, J; Mittal, V",2022,10.1177/00222429211057508,"This article examines the effect of political identity on customers' satisfaction with the products and services they consume. Recent work suggests that conservatives are less likely to complain than liberals. Building on that work, the present research examines how political identity shapes customer satisfaction, which has broad implications for customers and firms. Nine studies combine different methodologies, primary and secondary data, real and hypothetical behavior, different product categories, and diverse participant populations to show that conservatives (vs. liberals) are more satisfied with the products and services they consume. This happens because conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to believe in free will (i.e., that people have agency over their decisions) and, therefore, to trust their own decisions. The authors document the broad and tangible downstream consequences of this effect for customers' repurchase and recommendation intentions and firms' sales.

The Impact of Online and Offline Information Sources on Automobile Choice Behavior,"Kulkarni, G; Ratchford, BT; Kannan, PK",2012,10.1016/j.intmar.2012.02.001,"The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herding in online product choice,"Huang, JH; Chen, YF",2006,10.1002/mar.20119,"Previous research has shown that people are influenced by others when making decisions. This work presents three studies examining herding in product choices on the Internet. The first two studies addressed how two cues frequently found on the Internet, that is, sales volume and customer reviews, influence consumer on-line product choices. The third study examined the relative effectiveness of two recommendation sources. The experimental results revealed that subjects used the choices and evaluations of others as cues for making their own choices. However, herding effects are offset significantly by negative comments from others.

Optimal Referral Bonuses with Asymmetric Information: Firm-Offered and Interpersonal Incentives,"Kornish, LJ; Li, QP",2010,10.1287/mksc.1080.0484,"Referral bonuses, in which an existing customer gets an in-kind or cash reward for referring a new customer, are a popular way to stimulate word of mouth. In this paper, we examine key firm decisions about such bonuses. Others have studied referral bonus programs; a key difference is that we study the role of recommendations not just in spreading awareness (as they do) but also in providing assessments. We start with the idea that people have a variety of reasons for making product recommendations, including placing a value on a friend's outcome with a product they recommend. We apply that idea in a context of asymmetric information: A customer combines his knowledge about the product and his familiarity with friends' tastes, making him more informed than the friends. Thus, the recommendation is a signal about the value of the product to the friend. In this setting, we consistently find that the greater the concern for others' outcomes, the higher the referral bonus should be, as long as the firm cannot more efficiently motivate recommendations with a lower price. Moreover, if price is the more efficient lever, the optimal bonus is zero, and the optimal price is low. We also show that greater concern tends to reduce firm profit and, in some cases, actually reduces consumer welfare as well.",word of mouth; reward programs; pricing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the implementation of referral bonus programs and the optimization of such programs, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that translate strategic goals into structured actions like customer acquisition and sales promotion.",15,65,15,0,5

Why analyst overconfidence about the functional form of demand models can lead to overpricing,"Montgomery, AL; Bradlow, ET",1999,10.1287/mksc.18.4.569,"Generally, profit predictions are made conditional upon a particular functional form. The typical caveat offered is that this is not the true demand model, but is instead some reasonable approximation. We show how the notion of an approximation can be explicitly represented using a random coefficient model. Our model nests the usual situation of complete model certainty as a special case. We go on to show how ignoring the uncertainty in functional form induced by approximation will lead to erroneous pricing decisions that may frequently lead to overpricing. For example, an inelastic, double-log demand model implies infinite optimal prices. This is clearly a nonsensical, analyst recommendation. We propose a more general form of the double-log model that allows for high confidence in the observed price range, but incorporates increased uncertainty about the adequacy of the double-log approximation as prices move beyond the observed range. The optimal pricing solutions for this new model are lower than those for the usual case with complete certainty. In fact, we find well-defined optimal pricing solutions even for inelastic double-log demand models. This is a finding of great practical importance, given that aggregate demand models tend to be inelastic for grocery categories, and that log demand models are frequently used (Hoch et al. 1995). We argue that the lack of recognizing uncertainty in the modeling process may partially account for why there is a seeming disparity between observed retail prices and the optimal prices implied by maximizing total category profits using estimated demand models (Little and Shapiro 1980). The problems of making optimal pricing decisions using double-log demand models calibrated with store-level scanner data have been recognized. Previous solutions are to constrain the results to achieve reasonable solutions (Reibstein and Gatignon 1984, Montgomery 1997) or to avoid these models altogether in favor of household choice models aggregated to the store-level (Vilcassim and Chintagunta 1995). Our assessment of the problem is that it is not necessarily an issue of model specification, but one of inference. In other words, double-log models fit well, but optimization leads to out-of-range predictions. Our suggestion is that inferences from an estimated demand model need to be approached with some caution. Specifically, uncertainty about predictions will always exist. If this uncertainty is incorporated into models such as the double-log form, then much better inferences can be made. It is our hope that this research will encourage others to think not only about model specification and estimation, but also inference.",approximations; demand estimation; pricing research; random; coefficient models; retailing,INFORMS,wos-recommendation,Strategic,"The abstract discusses the implications of model uncertainty in pricing decisions, focusing on long-term impacts and optimal pricing strategies, which aligns with strategic planning.",60,25,10,0,5

Design/methodology/approach By adapting items from prior studies, a structured questionnaire was developed and distributed face-to-face to various Muslim fashion stores in Malaysia. After a one-month effort, 221 responses were obtained from non-Muslim consumers by using convenience sampling. Next, a clustering analysis was used to classify them from a contrasting perspective. Finally, regression and Andrew F. Hayes's process procedures were applied to examine the three independent variables' effect and the moderating variables. Findings The results revealed the characteristic behaviour of the non-Muslim women explicitly, which is related to their halal fashion purchasing decision.

INNOVATIONS AND TOURISM REGIONS: ARE INNOVATIONS PERCEIVED AS A PROBLEM IN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPEAN TOURISM?,"Kubickova, V; Labudova, V; Benesova, D; Mura, L",2023,10.21272/mmi.2023.3-17,"This article examines innovative aspects of the development of tourism regions in Europe. The article aims to determine the intensity of the perception of innovation in the tourism region as a problem in its development. The ambition of the article is to assess the problems in the development of tourism regions in Europe in the field of innovation as a possible starting point for optimizing changes in local and regional tourism policy. The research analyses the positions of 95 regional tourism experts from 17 European countries. The database was based on a databank of 150 representatives of academia and 275 representatives of regional tourism organizations. To analyse the properties of categorical data and the relationships between them, we used Gamma, Kendall's Tau-b, Somers' D C vertical bar R, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi Coefficient, Contingency Coefficient, Cramer's V and the decision tree algorithm. The maturity of the innovation environment of tourism regions and their level of development influence the perception of innovations as a problem in their development. Southern European tourism regions perceive innovation as a problem in their development most intensively. Tourism regions with stronger innovation activity have a well-established quality management system and a comprehensive and systematically addressed supply of seasonal and off-season products. Tourism regions ranked in the emerging innovator group perceive the specified problems in the implementation of innovations more intensively. This reflects the lack of coordination of the product portfolio, both in terms of range and quality, in countries where the innovation environment is poorly developed. A key recommendation to mitigate the perception of innovations as a problem in the development of Europe's tourism regions is to focus attention on the implementation of regional policy instruments that stimulate the participation of tourism in the synergy effects of the existing innovation environment of the economy.",innovation; innovation environment; perception of innovations; regional development; tourism region,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MANAGEMENT INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY",wos-recommendation,Strategic,"The article focuses on long-term development issues in tourism regions, particularly regarding innovation and regional policy optimization, which align with strategic planning.",70,10,10,5,5
The impact of digital transformation on the retailing value chain,"Reinartz, W; Wiegand, N; Imschloss, M",2019,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2018.12.002,"Consumers have traditionally made purchase decisions at the store shelf, giving institutional brick-and-mortar retailers great power to learn about and influence behaviors and preferences. With the rise of e-commerce, mobile shopping, and most recently smart technologies, new competitors threaten this long-standing supremacy. Adopting a value-creation perspective, we analyze how digitization started the erosion of institutional retailing as the primary interface to the customer. We develop a framework that identifies five new sources of value creation and propose how these advance and transform competition for this interface. Depending on the importance of the new sources of value creation (in different purchase situations), stationary retailing may prevail as an important interaction point in a multichannel decision journey. However, increasing diffusion of branded-product platforms including connected devices and online retail platforms is shifting this authority to new players.

I love the product but will you? The role of interpersonal attachment styles in social projection,"David, ME",2018,10.1002/mar.21080,"Individuals often have a need to predict the preferences of others (e.g., offering a recommendation, gift giving). In doing so, it is not uncommon that individuals project their attitudes and preferences onto others. Extant consumer research literature related to social projection focuses largely on particular situational variables that influence social projection. The current research adds to a smaller body of consumer research which focuses on specific characteristics of consumers' selves that may drive an individual's tendency to project his/her attitudes onto others. Specifically, the present paper explores an individual-level moderator of social projection, namely, interpersonal attachment style. Across five studies, interpersonal attachment style, and attachment anxiety, specifically, is shown to influence social projection. In addition, the mechanism underlying this relationship is demonstrated.

Brand identity fit in co-branding The moderating role of C-B identification and consumer coping,"Xiao, N; Lee, SH",2014,10.1108/EJM-02-2012-0075,"Purpose - This paper aims to introduce brand identity (BI) fit as an important factor that influences co-branding success. Based on motivated reasoning theory, the authors propose consumer-brand (C-B) identification moderates the effect of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. In addition, they investigate the role of consumer coping and perceived BI fit on consumers' attitude toward co-branding. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were conducted to test the research hypotheses. Findings - Study 1 results reveal that when C-B identification is low, consumers' co-branding evaluations and the loyalty of the focal brand are higher in the low BI fit condition than those in the high BI fit condition. When C-B identification is high, such effects are not observed. Study 2 results reveal that when the BI fit is low, decoupling is more effective than biased assimilation at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. Research limitations/implications - First, while the authors focus particularly on BI fit, it may be fruitful for marketers to combine BI fit with other types of fit such as functional dimension fit and product category fit. For example, while the results suggest marketers should co-brand with low BI fit pairs when targeting at low C-B identification consumers, this recommendation should be taken in conjunction with how consumers respond to other co-branding fit strategies. Second, the authors encourage future researchers to explore deeper into the consumer coping in other contexts. As these elements are critical to consumers' attitudes, it will be beneficial to see how decoupling or biased assimilation strategies differ in other co-branding fit contexts. Practical implications - The authors advise marketers to consider both the level of BI fit and the level of C-B identification when looking for a co-brand partner. When targeting low C-B identification consumers, it is better for marketers to find a co-branding partner with a low BI fit than high BI fit. This is a counterintuitive finding given that higher fit (e. g. product category fit and brand image fit) is often associated with positive evaluations. For high C-B identification consumers, BI fit does not adversely affect consumer attitudes (and loyalty). Thus, these consumers are safer targets for marketers in terms of maintaining attitudes. Second, the authors find that when perceived BI fit is low, decoupling strategy is more effective than biased assimilation strategy at defending the positive evaluations of the focal brand. However, when perceived BI fit is high, the two coping strategies have little difference in influencing co-branding attitudes. Thus, the authors advise marketers to encourage their consumers to cope using a decoupling strategy to garner higher attitudes. Originality/value - The authors introduce BI fit as an important abstract dimension of brand image fit when facing co-branding decisions. Overall, our results demonstrate C-B identification moderates the effects of BI fit on co-branding attitudes. Counter-intuitively, the results suggest that low BI fit co-branding can also generate higher attitudes depending on consumers' level of brand identification. Moreover, marketers must also be wary of how consumers cope with co-branding, as coping explains the underlying mechanism of how consumers deal with high or low perceived BI fit. Specifically, our findings suggest that consumer coping moderates the relationship between perceived BI fit and co-branding attitudes.",Brand identity fit; Co-branding; Consumer coping; Consumer-brand identification,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,wos-recommendation,Tactical,"The abstract discusses specific strategies for co-branding based on brand identity fit and consumer-brand identification, which align with tactical decision-making in marketing.

Reducing deviant consumer behaviour with service robot guardians,"Dootson, P; Greer, DA; Letheren, K; Daunt, KL",2023,10.1108/JSM-11-2021-0400,"Purpose The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.",Service innovation; Consumer deviance; Robotics; Servicescape,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,wos-robot,Strategic,"The research explores the long-term implications of deploying service robots in service environments, particularly how their perceived humanness impacts consumer behavior and organizational investment decisions.",60,20,10,5,5
Customer Perceptions among Product and Brand Alternatives: Analysis and Consolidation of Models of Brand Choice Behavior,"Teleaba, F; Popescu, S; Ilesan, H",2021,,"Understanding how consumers evaluate product and brand alternatives and perceive their quality should be of paramount importance to marketing, product development and quality management.

Designing marketing content for social commerce to drive consumer purchase behaviors: A perspective from speech act theory,"Wang, F; Xu, HF; Hou, RL; Zhu, Z",2023,10.1016/j.jretconser.2022.103156,"With the emergence of content-driven social commerce, designing marketing content that better stimulates consumer purchase behaviors has become increasingly essential. However, it remains unclear what and how linguistic features of marketing content in emerging social commerce influence consumer purchase behaviors. Drawing on speech act theory, this paper proposes a multi-level research model to conceptualize the linguistic features of content from the aspects of word usage (micro level), within-content argument development (macro level), and between-content linguistic mimicry (meta level), and investigate their impact on consumer purchase behaviors. With a unique dataset that includes 44,256 textual posts from JD WeChat shopping circle (a content -driven social commerce platform), this paper combines text mining methods with a series of regression analyses to test the research model. The empirical analyses find that the number of customers who make a purchase increases 1) at the micro-level due to self-referencing and detailing, 2) at the macro-level due to argument structuring, and 3) at the meta-level due to linguistic style matching, while linguistic content matching nega-tively affects the number of customers. These findings reveal how content creators strategically use language to design marketing content that encourages consumer purchase behaviors in emerging social commerce.

As a starting point, we propose analyzing a sample of comments before initiating text mining. Using a combination of real data and simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is superior to the two most popular sampling methods-simple random sampling and stratified random sampling-in gaining insights from the data. In addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and the added expense of a larger sample.

Understanding what concerns consumers: a semantic approach to product feature extraction from consumer reviews,"Wei, CP; Chen, YM; Yang, CS; Yang, CC",2010,10.1007/s10257-009-0113-9,"The Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions (more specifically, consumer reviews) about products. Consumer reviews are essential for retailers and product manufacturers to understand the general responses of customers to their products and improve their marketing campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, consumer reviews enable retailers to recognize the specific preferences of each customer, which facilitates effective marketing decisions. As the number of consumer reviews expands, it is essential and desirable to develop an efficient and effective sentiment analysis technique that is capable of extracting product features stated in consumer reviews (i.e., product feature extraction) and determining the sentiments (positive or negative semantic orientations) of consumers for these product features (i.e., opinion orientation identification). Product feature extraction is critical to sentiment analysis, because its effectiveness significantly affects the performance of opinion orientation identification, as well as the ultimate effectiveness of sentiment analysis. Therefore, this study concentrates on product feature extraction from consumer reviews. Specifically, we propose a semantic-based product feature extraction (SPE) technique that exploits a list of positive and negative adjectives defined in the General Inquirer to recognize opinion words semantically and subsequently extract product features expressed in consumer reviews. Using a prevalent product feature extraction technique and the SPE-GI technique (a variant of SPE) as performance benchmarks, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed SPE technique outperforms both benchmark techniques.",Consumer review; Sentiment analysis; Product feature extraction; Opinion summarization; Text mining,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,wos-text mining,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the development of a sentiment analysis technique for extracting product features from consumer reviews, which relates to specific marketing activities and decisions.

More Than Words: The Influence of Affective Content and Linguistic Style Matches in Online Reviews on Conversion Rates,"Ludwig, S; de Ruyter, K; Friedman, M; BrÃ¼ggen, EC; Wetzels, M; Pfann, G",2013,10.1509/jm.11.0560,"Customers increasingly rely on other consumers' reviews to make purchase decisions online. New insights into the customer review phenomenon can be derived from studying the semantic content and style properties of verbatim customer reviews to examine their influence on online retail sites' conversion rates. The authors employ text mining to extract changes in affective content and linguistic style properties of customer book reviews on Amazon.com. A dynamic panel data model reveals that the influence of positive affective content on conversion rates is asymmetrical, such that greater increases in positive affective content in customer reviews have a smaller effect on subsequent increases in conversion rate. No such tapering-off effect occurs for changes in negative affective content in reviews. Furthermore, positive changes in affective cues and increasing congruence with the product interest group's typical linguistic style directly and conjointly increase conversion rates. These findings suggest that managers should identify and promote the most influential reviews in a given product category, provide instructions to stimulate reviewers to write powerful reviews, and adapt the style of their own editorial reviews to the relevant product category.",online customer reviews; affective content; linguistic style match; conversion rate; Internet marketing,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,wos-text mining,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the influence of customer reviews on conversion rates and provides actionable insights for managers to optimize review strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into targets and structured decisions.",10,70,15,0,5

Modeling the role of message content and influencers in social media rebroadcasting,"Zhang, YC; Moe, WW; Schweidel, DA",2017,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.07.003,"We develop a model that examines the role of content, content-user fit, and influence on social media rebroadcasting behavior. While previous research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our modeling approach also accounts for a message's fit with users, based on the content of the message and the content of messages typically shared by users. As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted) by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1) content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users. We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media messages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing from linguistics and sociology research, the authors posit that comparative reviews, which highlight the similarities and differences between a focal product and its alternatives, may influence consumers' regulation systems and perceived credibility, thereby affecting product sales. The authors examined 61,480 reviews on e-commerce platforms to explore the effects of comparative reviews and their valence on product sales. By using a supervised learning approach, they identified positive and negative comparative reviews, as well as positive and negative regular reviews, and then applied a two-way fixed-effects model. The results show that comparative reviews positively impacted product sales. Specifically, positive comparative reviews had a greater effect than positive regular reviews, whereas negative comparative reviews had a lesser absolute effect than negative regular reviews on product sales. Moreover, positive comparative reviews exerted a greater absolute effect than negative ones. A follow-up controlled lab study further substantiated the authors' results and insights.
