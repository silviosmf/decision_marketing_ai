"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models fire the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the right model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a generic model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward automating the crucial task of choice model selection.","Farias, VF; Jagabathula, S; Shah, D",Tactical,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,nonparametric choice; choice models; revenue prediction; utility preference; preference list; marketing mix,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a method for predicting revenues from consumer choice models and optimizing offer sets, which align with tactical decision-making focused on short-term goals and structured processes.",wos-prediction,10,70,A Nonparametric Approach to Modeling Choice with Limited Data,2013
"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be realistic in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or basecase scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base- case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base- case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because de. ning the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base- case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment.","Gilbride, TJ; Lenk, PJ; Brazell, JD",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,Bayesian decision theory; conjoint analysis; constrained optimization; cross-validation; hierarchical Bayes; loss function; market share prediction; penalized maximum likelihood; posterior risk,10.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to conjoint analysis, focusing on the recovery of base-case market shares and consumer preferences, which relates to managing day-to-day marketing research activities.",wos-prediction,10,20,Market Share Constraints and the Loss Function in Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis,2008
"This paper examines the cross-fertilizations of random utility models with the study of decision making under risk and uncertainty. We start with a description of the expected utility (EU) theory and then consider deviations from the standard EU frameworks, involving the Allais paradox and the Ellsberg paradox, inter alia. We then discuss how the resulting non-EU framework can be modeled and estimated within the framework of discrete choices in static and dynamic contexts. Our objectives in addressing risk and ambiguity in individual choice contexts are to understand the decision choice process and to use behavioral information for prediction, prescription, and policy analysis.","de Palma, A; Ben-Akiva, M; Brownstone, D; Holt, C; Magnac, T; McFadden, D; Moffatt, P; Picard, N; Train, K; Wakker, P; Walker, J",Operational,10.1007/s11002-008-9047-0,Discrete choice; Decision making; Risk; Uncertainty; (Cumulative) prospect theory; Ambiguity,10.0,,60,5,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses decision-making processes, particularly in the context of individual choices under risk and uncertainty, which aligns with operational activities such as choice modeling and determining consumer preferences.",wos-prediction,10,15,"Risk, uncertainty and discrete choice models",2008
"In contrast to books and compact discs, the number of complex services offered on the Internet is still small. The decision-making process for complex services is different because it has an additional intermediate step of indication of interest. The Web site is (a) visited and searched for information; subsequently, (b) a request for the service is made, which may lead to (c) a purchase. The authors acquired a unique data set from an online Dutch financial service provider, which offers services such as mortgage loans and insurance on the Internet on behalf of financial institutions. They also obtained information on whether the request for the service resulted in a purchase. The authors used the available information to predict the purchase using a latent class probit model. A direct managerial application of this model is the ability to identify and select profitable applicants, resulting in significant profit improvements for the company.","Vroomen, B; Donkers, B; Verhoef, PC; Franses, PH",Tactical,10.1177/1094670505276681,online purchase behavior; prediction; decision support system; Internet,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract describes the use of a latent class probit model to predict service purchases, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets like identifying profitable applicants and improving profits.",wos-prediction,10,70,Selecting profitable customers for complex services on the Internet,2005
"The tendency of bias identification and quantification with the goal of better estimation and prediction, grows. The purpose of this paper is to question how deep analysis is necessary to increase prediction of communication preferences given the customer's personality traits/biases. Examined communication preferences regard to the communication approach, language use and information sharing. This paper offers a psychometric assessment of the personality estimates and traits, as well as econometric examination of correlation to consumer first-choice communication preferences using linear logit model with binomial dependent variable. The results point out that the more detail analysis provides more accurate predictions, to the point where estimators as regressors for communication choices provide more accurate prediction than the use of the personality traits as independent variables. Paper delivers empirical assessment of consumers' communication preferences using primary data set. Practical implications relate to the use of the findings in communication with consumers in online and/ or digital marketing communication. One of the possible practical use of the results can be as an input for the recommendation agents. Theoretical implications of the findings request questioning the use of the personality traits as an interim stage in decision-making predictions. In addition, these findings fill the gap in the field of communication preference based on personality traits and personality estimators. The data set has been previously used for the doctoral thesis research. For the purpose of this research, data was re-coded and analyzed using different approach, namely binomial logistic regression.","Kostelic, K; Pavlovic, DK",Tactical,10.15240/tul/001/2018-3-009,Personality traits/biases; logistic regression; consumer decision-making; communication preferences,5.0,,10,0,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,"The abstract discusses the analysis of communication preferences based on consumer personality traits, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Firms employ temporal data for predicting sales and making managerial decisions accordingly. To use such data appropriately, managers need to make two major analysis decisions: (a) the temporal granularity (e.g., weekly, monthly) and (b) an accompanying demand model. In most empirical contexts, however, model selection, sales forecasts, and managerial decisions are vulnerable to both of these choices. Whereas extant literature has proposed methods that can select the best-fitted model (e.g., Bayesian information criterion) or provide predictions robust to model misspecification (e.g., weighted likelihood), most methods assume that the granularity is either correctly specified or prespecify it. Our research fills this gap by proposing a method, the scaled power likelihood with multiple weights (SPLM), that not only identifies the best-fitted granularity-model combination jointly, but also conducts doubly (granularity and model) robust prediction against their potentially incorrect selection. An extensive set of simulations shows that SPLM has higher statistical power than extant approaches for selecting the best-fitted granularity-model combination and provides doubly robust prediction in a wide variety of misspecified conditions. We apply our framework to predict sales for a scanner data set and find that, similar to our simulations, SPLM improves sales forecasts due to its ability to select the best-fitted pair via SPLM's dual weights.","Kim, MY; Bradlow, ET; Iyengar, R",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2021.1340,data granularity; granularity-model selection; doubly robust prediction,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The research focuses on improving sales forecasts through methods that assist in managerial decision-making regarding temporal granularity and demand models, which aligns with tactical decision-making.",wos-prediction,10,70,Selecting Data Granularity and Model Specification Using the Scaled Power Likelihood with Multiple Weights,2022
"Firms spend billions of dollars developing advertising content, yet there is little field evidence on how much or how it affects demand. We analyze a direct mail field experiment in South Africa implemented by a consumer lender that randomized advertising content, loan price, and loan offer deadlines simultaneously. We find that advertising content significantly affects demand. Although it was difficult to predict ex ante which specific advertising features would matter most in this context, the features that do matter have large effects. Showing fewer example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction in the interest rate. The evidence also suggests that advertising content persuades by appealing peripherally to intuition rather than reason. Although the advertising content effects point to an important role for persuasion and related psychology, our deadline results do not support the psychological prediction that shorter deadlines may help overcome time-management problems; instead, demand strongly increases with longer deadlines.","Bertrand, M; Karlan, D; Mullainathan, S; Shafir, E; Zinman, J",Tactical,10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.263,,5.0,,15,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"The abstract discusses the effects of advertising content on demand, indicating a practical approach to implementing advertising strategies.

"Objective: Identify a new model of predicting customer behavior based on new variables that can be used by marketing management and adapted to their business planning. Methodology: New model has been used, with the definition of new calculation systems of the traditional variables R, Recency, F, Frequency, and M, monetary value, (RFM), related to the business periods. Besides, activation in each period P becomes a key variable for constructing the purchase cohorts of customers and identifying their potential. A new variable, Activation Loyalty, is recognized as a good proxy of the likelihood of future customer purchases. The model builds a weighting through a multiple regression analysis obtaining beta for each variable, including the periods of activation, presenting the relative effect of the variables, and the best global explanation of the model. Results: This new model, RFMAP, which includes Activation Periods and Activation Loyalty, presents a higher prediction accuracy and improvements over traditional models with a clear impact, useful and manageable lines of segmentation, and prioritization for marketing management in CRM systems. Limitations: The main limitation of this model consists that it is based on data of only one company, and it should show the value in other sectors and give a full insight through its transversal application. Practical implications: The involved advantages demonstrated better predictability and usefulness to decision-makers, not only to determine the best customers but also with lapsed ones. It gives a meaningful explanation of differences in customer behavior, which are present in the data and are being reflected in the model. Also, it provides a prescriptive prioritization of variables to be managed in the marketing plan and how to be implemented.","Vilaginés, JA",Tactical,10.7200/esicm.167.0513.4,RFM model; RFMAP; activation periods; activation loyalty; customer base analysis,5.0,,15,0,ESCUELA SUPERIOR GESTION COMERCIAL & MARKETING,"The abstract discusses the development of a new predictive model for customer behavior that interprets strategic goals into actionable insights for marketing management.

"Background High budget impact (BI) estimates of new drugs have led to decision-making challenges potentially resulting in restrictions in patient access. However, current BI predictions are rather inaccurate and short term. We therefore developed a new approach for BI prediction. Here, we describe the validation of our BI prediction approach using oncology drugs as a case study. Methods We used Dutch population-level data to estimate BI where BI is defined as list price multiplied by volume. We included drugs in the antineoplastic agents ATC category which the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered a New Active Substance and received EMA marketing authorization (MA) between 2000 and 2017. A mixed-effects model was used for prediction and included tumor site, orphan, first in class or conditional approval designation as covariates. Data from 2000 to 2012 were the training set. BI was predicted monthly from 0 to 45 months after MA. Cross-validation was performed using a rolling forecasting origin with e<^>|Ln(observed BI/predicted BI)| as outcome. Results The training set and validation set included 25 and 44 products, respectively. Mean error, composed of all validation outcomes, was 2.94 (median 1.57). Errors are higher with less available data and at more future predictions. Highest errors occur without any prior data. From 10 months onward, error remains constant. Conclusions The validation shows that the method can relatively accurately predict BI. For payers or policymakers, this approach can yield a valuable addition to current BI predictions due to its ease of use, independence of indications and ability to update predictions to the most recent data.","Geenen, JW; Belitser, SV; Vreman, RA; van Bloois, M; Klungel, OH; Boersma, C; Hövels, AM",Out of scope,10.1007/s10198-020-01176-x,Budget impact; Oncology; Medicines; Budget impact estimation; Prediction modeling; Validation study,0.0,,5,85,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a new approach for predicting budget impact (BI) of oncology drugs, which is primarily a healthcare-related topic rather than a marketing-focused application.",wos-prediction,5,5,A novel method for predicting the budget impact of innovative medicines: validation study for oncolytics,2020
"Purpose Alternative payment means have been expanding rapidly in recent years. The need to identify the segments of customers that are targetable for both financial and nonfinancial institutions is growing. The purpose of this paper is to use two different methods, discriminant analysis and decision trees, in order to compare the effectiveness of the two methods for segmentation and identify critical consumer characteristics which determine behavior and preference in relation to the use of payment means. Design/methodology/approach Using data from 321 bank customers, decision tree and discriminant analysis methods are used, first to test the same set of variables differentiating the customers and then to compare the respective results and prediction ability of the two methods. Findings Results show that discriminant analysis has a better model fit and segments the customers in a more effective way than the decision tree method. In addition, each method shows different variables to differentiate the customer groups. Research limitations/implications The findings are limited to the sector and country of the study, as well as the convenience sample that has been used. Practical implications Suggestions for financial managers to better understand their customers' behavior and target the right group are discussed. Originality/value This is the first attempt to compare decision trees and discriminant analysis as alternative segmentation methods for payment means.","Dimitriadis, S; Kyrezis, N; Chalaris, M",Tactical,10.1108/IJBM-10-2016-0157,Decision trees; Segmentation; Discriminant analysis; Payment means,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,The abstract discusses the use of decision-making methods (discriminant analysis and decision trees) to segment customers based on their behavior and preferences regarding payment means.

"Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing). The authors identify boundary conditions, generalize to other prediction formats, and demonstrate consequences of their findings.","Bagchi, R; Ince, EC",Tactical,10.1509/jmr.12.0526,event prediction; subjective probability; accuracy; outcomes; forecasting,5.0,,20,5,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,"The abstract discusses how consumers interpret forecasts in relation to predictions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and consumer behavior analysis.",wos-prediction,10,60,Is a 70% Forecast More Accurate Than a 30% Forecast?

"The role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is recognized globally given their contribution to total productivity and job opportunities. However, the majority of SMEs tend to fail due to a lack of marketing knowledge and managerial skills or technical expertise. Professional accountants are in a unique situation to help SME owner/managers to achieve their business objectives and bridge the skills gap. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the factors that affect the decisions of owner/managers of SMEs in Iranian manufacturing sector to utilise the professional accountants' advisory services and to examine the impact of these advisory services on SME performance using the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm. Based on a questionnaire survey data of 658 Iranian manufacturing SMEs, our regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services and three independent variables, namely, knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions. Furthermore, we evidence that the use of advisory services is significant and positively associated with SME performance. More importantly, utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services partially mediates the relationship between knowledge of owner/manager, competitive intensity and complexity of marketing decisions and firm performance. Therefore, we provide a specific, theoretically and empirically grounded prediction of how utilisation of professional accountants' advisory services influences performance with implications for theory and practice.","Kamyabi, Y; Devi, S",Strategic,10.4102/sajbm.v43i2.184,,5.0,,10,5,AOSIS,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of utilizing professional accountants' advisory services in SMEs, aiming to identify factors affecting management decisions and their overall performance.

"Managing the allocation of shelf space for new products is a problem of significant importance for retailers. The problem is particularly complex for exhibitors-the retailers in the motion picture supply chain-because they face dynamic challenges, given the short Life cycles of movies, the changing level of demand over time, the scarcity of shelf space, and the complex revenue sharing contract between the exhibitor and the distributor. In the face of this complexity, the aim of current research is to provide a structure for analyzing management problems of exhibitors in the movie industry. Using a mathematical programming approach and a fast, but readily accessible algorithm, we propose a decision support model, SilverScreener, whose aim is to help exhibitors make effective and timely decisions regarding theater screens management. The major objective is to help select and schedule movies for a multiple-screens theater over a fixed planning horizon in such a way that the exhibitor's cumulative profit is maximized. By treating the multiple screens as parallel machines and the movies as jobs, we provide an analogy of the current problem to the parallel machine scheduling problem. We formulate the resulting problem as an integer program. We depart from the typical parallel machine scheduling problems by introducing the time-indexed formulation that is particularly useful for solving the current problem. An important distinction between the current problem and typical machine scheduling problems is that the present approach allows for the choice of which movies to play; typically, in machine scheduling, all jobs have to be scheduled. We provide various analyses of normative versus actual decision making, based on publicly available data. The developed model is readily implementable and appears to lead to improved profitability in different comparative cases. Through sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the above results are robust to variations in various parameters of the problem. The main findings and insights from the normative policy suggest the following: Based on SilverScreener's recommendations, the exhibitor can achieve substantially higher cumulative profit. The improvement over actual decisions in terms of profitability appears to result from a combination of better selection and scheduling of the movies. The general structure of the exhibitor's normative decision is: choose fewer right movies and ran them longer. We propose a two-tier integrated application of the model to show how the model can be applied to realistic decision making. The first tier involves development of a movie selection plan to help the manager plan an entire season and bid for movies before the start of that season. An ex ante revenue prediction scheme is developed, based intuitively on a matching of the forthcoming movies with similar movies played in this theater previously. If the forthcoming season's scheduling plan can be visualized as a two-dimensional (week-by-screen) matrix, then that matrix contains only empty cells before the first tier. After a bid plan is developed, the exhibitor can fill some of those empty cells. The remaining empty cells represent slots, which can be decided during the season by either extending movies the exhibitor booked before the season or by scheduling other movies which may become available later in the season, This motivates the second tier-adaptive scheduling approach-of the integrated approach. The second tier helps the exhibitor in weekly decision making during the season. This application involves rolling, and updating data, from one time window to another. The approaches followed in the two tiers of the integrated application are quite general in that they can incorporate a sophisticated demand prediction model, managerial judgments, or a combination of both. We also propose an alternative behavioral decision rule (heuristic), which exemplifies relationship dilemmas in the movie industry. This heuristic shows that the exhibitors need to be selective in their choice of movies and may suffer a substantial loss in profitability if they place too much emphasis on accommodating distributors.","Swami, S; Eliashberg, J; Weinberg, CB",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.18.3.352,movies; decision support systems; retailing; scheduling; integer programming,5.0,,10,0,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses a decision support model for exhibitors in the movie industry to optimize movie selection and scheduling, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"We develop a model of the evolution of inter-purchase times for a consumer-packaged product. After the introduction of the product, a consumer waits to make the initial purchase, then either waits to repurchase or decides not to. A repurchasing consumer repeats this decision process. The components of the model are the repurchase probability and the density function of the time to repurchase at each stage of the purchasing cycle. Issues of interest are: the strength of the dependency between successive repurchase times; the number of repeat purchases before stability occurs; the effects of consumer characteristics on inter-purchase times. The model of individual purchasing behaviour can be transformed via simulation to produce sales time series for a given population. As an example, the model is estimated for a product using Australian panel data. The accuracy of the model's prediction is compared with an existing model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"In most marketing experiments, managerial decisions are not based directly on the estimates of the parameters but rather on functions of these estimates. For example, many managerial decisions are driven by whether or not a feature is valued more than the price the consumer will be asked to pay. In other cases, some managerial decisions are weighed more heavily than others. The standard measures used to evaluate experimental designs (e.g., A-efficiency or D-efficiency) do not accommodate these phenomena. We propose alternative managerial efficiency criteria (M-errors) that are relatively easy to implement. We explore their properties, suggest practical algorithms to decrease errors, and provide illustrative examples. Realistic examples suggest improvements of as much as 30% in managerial efficiency. We close by considering approximations for nonlinear criteria and extensions to choice-based experiments.","Toubia, O; Hauser, JR",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1060.0244,conjoint analysis; experimental design; product development; efficiency,5.0,,20,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses alternative managerial efficiency criteria (M-errors) that can be implemented to improve decision-making in marketing experiments, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",wos-prediction,15,60,On managerially efficient experimental designs,2007
"Consumers incorrectly rely on their sense of understanding of what a company does to evaluate investment risk. In three correlational studies, greater sense of understanding was associated with lower risk ratings (Study 1) and with prediction distributions of future stock performance that had lower standard deviations and higher means (Studies 2 and 3). In all studies, sense of understanding was unassociated with objective risk measures. Risk perceptions increased when the authors degraded sense of understanding by presenting company information in an unstructured versus structured format (Study 4). Sense of understanding also influenced downstream investment decisions. In a portfolio construction task, both novices and seasoned investors allocated more money to hard-to-understand companies for a risk-tolerant client relative to a risk-averse one (Study 5).

"Historically, neither the creators nor the distributors of cultural products such as books or movies have used analytics - data, statistics, predictive modeling - to determine the likely success of their offerings. Instead, companies relied on the brilliance of tastemakers to predict and shape what people would buy. Creative judgment and expertise will always play a vital role in the creation, shaping and marketing of cultural products. But the balance between art and science is shifting. Today companies have unprecedented access to data and sophisticated technology that allows even the best-known experts to weigh factors and consider evidence that was unobtainable just a few years ago. And with increased cost and risk associated with the creation of cultural products, it has never been more important to get these decisions right. In this article, the authors describe the results of a study of prediction and recommendation efforts for a variety of cultural products. They discuss different approaches used to make predictions, the contexts in which these predictions are applied and the barriers to more extensive use, including the problem of decision making pre-creation. They then discuss two aspects of the prediction market.

"Purpose - The frequency and sophistication of consumer boycotts continue to increase from already high levels. Surprisingly, only limited research in marketing has investigated this topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic analysis of an actual consumer protest with implications for better managerial decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The animosity model of consumer purchase behavior was employed in two longitudinal studies to investigate an ongoing marketplace protest - Australian consumers' boycott of French products. Study 1 was carried out while France was engaged in nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Study 2 was carried out 1 year after the resolution of the conflict. Findings - Results from Study I show that Australian consumers' animosity toward France was negatively related to their willingness to purchase French products. Consistent with a key prediction from the animosity model, this effect was independent of evaluations of French product quality. The findings from Study 2 show that, a year after the cessation of nuclear testing, Australian consumers continue to have strong negative affect toward France, which in turn, had negative marketplace consequences for French products. Originality/value - While the results from Study 1 show that consumer anger over nuclear testing did not necessarily lead to the denigration of the quality of French goods, the second study indicates that, beyond the duration of the official protest, there may be repercussions for products associated with the offending party. Accordingly, managers should consider implementing communications programs which, over time, effectively reinforce the quality of their products in the minds of protesting consumers.","Ettenson, R; Klein, JG",Strategic,10.1108/02651330510593278,international business; consumer behaviour; brands,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,"The abstract discusses a long-term consumer boycott and its implications for managerial decisions, focusing on a strategic analysis of consumer behavior and the animosity model, which aligns with long-term organizational goals.",wos-prediction,60,20,The fallout from French nuclear testing in the South Pacific - A longitudinal study of consumer boycotts,2005
"The paper examines the effect of different payment modes on hedonic post-purchase product evaluations over time. Two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting and cognitive dissonance-suggest such an effect, but are contradictory regarding its direction. Additionally, the paper examines whether prospective consumers are able to correctly predict post-purchase evaluations and the effect of payment mode over time. In an online survey, hedonic evaluations of 346 car owners in three ownership phases (one, two, and three years after purchase) were measured and compared to predictions of 75 prospective car owners. Two different payment modes (down payment vs. installments) were distinguished. Results showed an interaction between payment mode and the hedonic evaluation of the car over time. In the first and third year, the evaluations by both groups were similar; in the second year, the installments group rated their cars more favorably than the down payment group. Neither of the two theoretical frameworks-mental accounting or cognitive dissonance-is sufficient to explain the observed relationship between payment mode and evaluation over time. The results suggest that mental accounting theory should be expanded with elements of cognitive dissonance. Regarding predictions, prospective car owners did not foresee the effect of payment mode on evaluations over time.

"PurposeThis study aims to develop a system dynamics (SD) simulation model to forecast the performance of the Indonesian halal industry to verify whether decision-making has been properly executed to increase the contribution of the success factors.Design/methodology/approachThis study establishes a SD-based model using three subsystems, namely, the halal assurance and certification process, the government and the export-import subsystem.FindingsThe best scenario is the third scenario or the combined scenario of providing facilities to accelerate the micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), carrying out halal certification, reducing the time for the certification process, increasing the number of the halal auditor and increasing the awareness from enterprises (both MSMEs and large enterprises) to carry out halal certification because of the internal and external motivations.Research limitations/implicationsFirst, the demand for certification of the type of food product is acquired using the number of SMEs and large companies. Second, the model does not include the government budget as a constraint.Practical implicationsThis study provides essential insights into implementing the best policies that can increase the performance of the halal industry.Social implicationsThis study revealed that relevant policy scenarios could be built after simulating and analyzing each scenario's effect on the halal industry's performance.Originality/valueThis study will enrich the scientific insight related to institutional theory and resource-based view, as those theories identify success factors associated with the performance of the halal food industry. This study will also enrich the scientific insight related to system dynamic methodology, as it is used to model the performance of the halal industry.","Susanty, A; Puspitasari, NB; Rosyada, ZF",Strategic,10.1108/JIMA-02-2023-0039,Performance; Halal industry; System dynamics; The best scenario,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on developing a system dynamics simulation model to forecast the performance of the halal industry, which aligns with long-term strategic planning to enhance decision-making and industry contributions.",wos-prediction,60,20,Prediction of the performance of halal food industry using a system dynamics simulation model,2024
"The authors propose amodel relating a product's comparative price to the construal level of its associated communications and show how perceived expensiveness shapes consumers' response to the wording of marketing communications. A series of six studies shows that for both absolute low-and high-cost product categories, comparatively expensive (inexpensive) products are preferred when accompanied by high-construal (low-construal) messages, due to the conceptual fluency of the match between price-induced psychological distance and construal level. The model provides novel implications for designing effective marketing communications: comparatively expensive versions of objectively low-priced products (e.g., an expensive chocolate truffle) are best promoted through more abstract slogans, whereas comparatively affordable versions of objectively high-priced products (e.g., an inexpensive diamond pendant) are best promoted using more concrete slogans. By emphasizing the link between comparative price and the matching level of construal, the authors contribute to a richer view of the interplay between price and product communication in marketing.","Allard, T; Griffin, D",Tactical,10.1509/jm.16.0018,price; construal level; psychological distance; expensiveness; advertising,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses a model relating product pricing to the effectiveness of marketing communications, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on optimizing marketing strategies.

"The early phase of launching a new apparel product is critical for gaining insights of its performance and classifying it into different categories such as fast selling, average selling, and slow selling. This information is crucial for optimizing product management strategies and making decisions regarding inventory planning, pricing, and marketing. Many apparel companies rely on rule-based methods conducted by experienced sales managers, which consume significant time and energy from managers and often result in delayed information and low prediction accuracy. We propose a new ranking based method to identify the product popularity that predicts regional and national rankings of products based on sales data at an early stage of a sales season. Our method enables companies to efficiently identify popular products within a remarkably short span of two to four weeks. To validate its efficacy, we compare the model's predictions with actual orders from a fashion company in 2021, showcasing a notable 5.9% increase in sales volume when using our approach to guide order decisions.","Wang, JY; Wu, SS; Jin, QW; Wang, YJ; Chen, C",Tactical,10.1287/inte.2023.0022,applications; predictive analytics; ranking-based method,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a ranking-based method for predicting product popularity during the early phases of a sales season, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at optimizing product management strategies.

"Despite the ubiquity of social networking sites, the online social networking industry is in search of effective marketing strategies to better profit from their established user base. Social media marketing strategies build on the premise that the social network of online users can be predicted and social influences among online users can be estimated. However, the existence of various heterogeneous social interactions on social networking sites presents a challenge for social network prediction and social influence estimation. In this article we draw upon the literatures on self-presentation on social networking sites and signaling in online social networking to categorize six heterogeneous online social interactions on social networking sites into two typesarticulated friendships and communication interactions. This article provides empirical evidence for the differences between articulated friendships and communication interactions and the corresponding articulated and communication networks. In order to compare the impacts of the social influences based on these two networks, we utilize support vector machines to build a classifier to predict virtual community membership and we further estimate the marginal effects of these social influences using a two-stage probit least squares method. We find significant explanatory power of social influences in predicting virtual community membership. Although the communication network is much sparser than the articulated network, social influences based on the communication network achieve similar performance as the articulated network. These findings provide important implications for social media marketing as well as the management of virtual communities.","Guo, H; Pathak, P; Cheng, HK",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12118,Computer-Mediated Communication; Online Social Influences; Social Networking Sites; Support Vector Machines; Virtual Community Membership,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses social media marketing strategies and empirical evidence regarding social influences on virtual community membership, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on structured goals and marketing analytics.",wos-prediction,20,60,Estimating Social Influences from Social Networking Sites-Articulated Friendships versus Communication Interactions,2015
"The nested logit model has been widely used to study nested choice. A typical example of such nested choice is store patronage and brand choice. An important limitation of the nested logit model is that it assumes that all alternatives at both levels of the nest are available in the choice set of the consumer. While there is a wide literature on the incorporation of restricted choice sets into the logit model, the logical extension of this analysis to nested restricted choice sets has not been pursued in the literature. In this study we develop a nested consideration model that integrates store choice and brand choice incorporating the formation of dynamic restricted choice sets of both stores and brands. We term the model the nested consideration model and derive the related probabilities in a manner analogous to the well-known nested logit model. In an empirical illustration, we find that the nested consideration model shows better prediction than nested logit models (with the same explanatory variables). We find that it is important to account for dynamic store consideration sets rather than static sets or store loyalty measures. We also conduct simulations to demonstrate the importance of the nested consideration set model for correct pricing and store location decisions of business managers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Most of the official data are released with a lag period, which increases the difficulties for decision-makers assessing the situation. To solve the problem of data lag, we used real-time Baidu Index to nowcast the Chinese consumer behavior of buying the best-selling smartphone, Huawei Mate 7. We introduced keywords like Mate 7 and Huawei in Baidu Index search queries to examine whether the introduction of real-time data can improve the efficiency of benchmark model. Overall, our finding is that the introduction of Baidu Index, both in-sample and out-of-sample, can improve the prediction accuracy of the model significantly. The extended model provided a 55.2% out-performance relative to benchmark one. This can not only make up for official data release lag, but also help firms gain near-real-time insight into the consumer demand trends and reduce inventory costs. The findings suggest that firms can improve marketing performance by use of search engine promotion campaign.","Fang, JC; Wu, WS; Lu, Z; Cho, EH",Tactical,10.1142/S021759081743007X,Search query data; Huawei; MIDAS,5.0,,15,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,"The abstract discusses the use of real-time data from Baidu Index to enhance prediction accuracy in consumer behavior, which aligns with the tactical level of marketing decisions focused on achieving specific targets related to consumer insights and demand trends.",wos-prediction,10,70,USING BAIDU INDEX TO NOWCAST MOBILE PHONE SALES IN CHINA,2019
"This article argues the importance of social embeddedness at mobile providers by examining the effects of customers' network topological properties on churn probabilitythe probability of a customer switching from one telecommunication provider to another. This article uses data from regional snowball samplingthe only practically feasible network sampling methodto identify groups with significantly different churn ratios for customers with different network topological properties. Clear evidence indicates that individual network characteristics (node-level metrics) have considerable impact on churn probabilities. The inclusion of network-related measures in the churn model allows a longer-term projection of churners and improves the predictive power of the model. With no possibility to carry out repeated sampling, sample stability was checked through simulation results. On the one hand, this article highlights the importance and effectiveness of the provider's tailored marketing campaigns by showing that customers targeted by direct marketing campaigns are less threatened by churn than nontargeted customers. On the other, this article shows that social embeddedness blocks the impact of the very same marketing efforts.

"The authors develop and estimate a model of online buying using clickstream data from a Web site that sells cars. The model predicts online buying by linking the purchase decision to what visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the authors decompose the purchase process into the completion of sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity across visitors at the county level. Using a sequence of binary probits, the authors model the visitor's decision of whether to complete each task for the first time, given that the visitor has completed the previous tasks at least once. The results indicate that visitors' browsing experiences and navigational behavior predict task completion for all decision levels. The results also indicate that the number of repeat visits per se is not diagnostic of buying propensity and that a site's offering of sophisticated decision aids does not guarantee increased conversion rates. The authors also compare the predictive performance of the task-completion approach with single-stage benchmark models in a holdout sample.

In particular, this research draws on an expected-utility model of risky sexual behavior to test its basic prediction that in certain conditions, changes in risk perceptions induced by HIV testing can result in an increase in risky sexual behavior. The results of two experimental studies using projective scenarios provide general support for the predictions that stem from the expected-utility model, particularly in conditions of low infection likelihood.

"Imagine you are a real estate agent and are showing a prospective buyer a house with a lake view, but it is foggy, and the view is less than ideal. Are you inclined to tell the prospective buyer, Unfortunately, it is foggy outside. If it were not foggy, the view would be even better!? Eight studies, spanning diverse domains, reveal a novel discrepancy: most presenters (e.g., the seller) choose to communicate such upward counterfactual information (UCI) to experiencers (e.g., the prospective buyer), believing it will enhance experiencers' impressions (e.g., of the house)-yet UCI actually worsens their impressions. This discrepancy arises because presenters insufficiently account for the fact that they possess more knowledge about the presented target than experiencers do; they fail to realize that noting an imperfection reveals it. Accordingly, when experiencers are knowledgeable about the target, either because the imperfection is obvious or because they can easily envision the upward counterfactual, the discrepancy attenuates. Finally, the presenter-experiencer discrepancy occurs only when the counterfactual information is upward, such that presenters do not overcommunicate downward counterfactual information, which rules out a desire to share any information as an alternative mechanism for presenters' communication decisions. Together, this research highlights the prevalence and costs of sharing UCI.","Li, XL; Hsee, CK; O'Brien, E",Not identified,10.1177/00222437221112312,prediction errors; self-other asymmetry; communication; egocentrism; counterfactual thinking,60.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses a psychological phenomenon related to communication and presentation of information, which does not clearly fit into the defined categories of Strategic, Tactical, or Operational decision-making in marketing.

Building on theory related to the benefits of identifying, maintaining and emphasizing one's own core organizational identity, Liberal Art Colleges are predicted to experience increased institutional appeal from pursuing such a strategy. Practically, this prediction implies that the predominant industry practice of Liberal Arts Colleges to consistently evolve and change form in response to their shifting environments may be misguided and thus detrimental to the long-term viability of the institution.

"Although the assumption of utility-maximizing consumers has been challenged for decades, empirical applications of alternative choice rules are still very new. We add to this growing body of literature by proposing a model based on the idea of a satisficing decision maker. In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them. The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial logit model.","Stüttgen, P; Boatwright, P; Monroe, RT",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1120.0732,noncompensatory choice; eye tracking; visual conjoint experiment,5.0,,65,5,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a model for consumer decision-making that involves evaluating alternatives and making choices, which aligns with day-to-day consumer activities and preferences.

"The prevalent multichannel shopping environment is driving many consumers to choose between online and offline channel at the information search and product purchase stages of a shopping experience. Consequently, multichannel retailers face the challenges of identifying different target consumer groups and maximizing the value of each channel by understanding and serving each group more effectively. Hence, this study attempts to identify consumer segments by examining consumers' perceived channel values at different shopping stages. The latent class MNL (LC-MNL) method, as a powerful tool that is able to detect consumer heterogeneity in the same consumption scenarios, is applied to conduct consumer segmentation analysis based on the consumer's perceived values, including channel benefits and costs, as well as different channels' characteristics. By using the survey data of 1325 consumers, results indicate two segments comprising innovative consumers and conventional consumers in terms of online vs. offline channel usage. Furthermore, the logit regressions for segments estimation illustrate that the two segments are significantly different in terms of channel attributes and consumers' intrinsic channel preferences. This study contributes to the extant electronic commerce and multichannel marketing literature by designing a rigorous consumer segmentation method which incorporates both interpretation and prediction capabilities and analyzing the underlying influential factors for different segments. The results can further provide useful guidance to marketing and sales practitioners in designing effective channel attributes to meet the needs of consumers belonging to different segments.","Wang, QS; Yang, X; Song, PJ; Sia, CL",Strategic,,Multichannel and multistage shopping; Consumer segmentation; Perceived channel value; Latent class MNL approach,5.0,,10,0,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV,The study focuses on long-term consumer segmentation strategies for multichannel retailers by identifying distinct consumer groups based on their perceived values and preferences.

"Accelerating antiglobalization challenges previously undisputed assumptions about the importance of a product's globalness/localness in purchase decisions. Putting these assumptions to test, this article conceptualizes globalness/localness as a distinct product attribute and decomposes its utility into weight and preference components. Subsequently, it offers an equity-theory-based prediction of the attribute's declining relevance/trivialization and quantifies its trade-offs with other attributes by calculating global/local price premiums. Conjoint experiments in two countries (Austria and India) reveal that (1) emerging- (developed-) market consumers exhibit relative preference for global (local) products, (2) emerging-market consumers perceive higher preference inequity between global and local products than developed-market consumers, and (3) the corresponding inequity triggers consumers' cognitive inequity regulation (manifested through attribute trivialization in developed markets) and behavioral inequity regulation (manifested through asymmetrical willingness to pay for global/local products across developed/emerging markets). In addition, attribute trivialization and price premium tolerance are moderated by consumers' spatial identities and price segment. The findings contribute to the theoretical debate on the relevance of product globalness/localness in deglobalizing times and inform competitive strategies; segmentation, targeting, and positioning; and international pricing decisions.","Davvetas, V; Sichtmann, C; Saridakis, C; Diamantopoulos, A",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X221143095,global; local products; attribute trade-offs; conjoint analysis; emerging; developed markets,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the implications of globalness/localness as product attributes in the context of changing consumer preferences and market dynamics, which aligns with long-term strategic planning and competitive strategies.",wos-prediction,60,25,"The Global/Local Product Attribute: Decomposition, Trivialization, and Price Trade-Offs in Emerging and Developed Markets",2023

"Companies offering a wide range of products may have an interest in measuring the degree of diversity of their clients' shopping baskets as an indicator of consumer behaviour. Customers buying a wide range of products are somehow more dependent on the business and their switching costs might be higher compared to others that only buy a small number of products from your catalogue.

First, the objective of this paper is to take advantage of some approaches used in other fields to create a new measurement. Second, we will show some possible applications of this indicator in a business context. We consider that a client with low heterogeneity is not highly dependent on the business and is more likely to defect. To check if this intuition is true, we will test the dependence of heterogeneity and churn with real data.

Extending the traditional discrete choice model by incorporating latent psychological factors can help to better understand the individual's decision-making process and therefore to yield more reliable part-worth estimates and market share predictions. Several integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) models which merge the conditional logit model with a structural equation model exist in the literature. They assume homogeneity in the part-worths and use latent variables to model the heterogeneity among the respondents.

"Expiration dates are used by couponers to limit their financial liability temporally. Traditional wisdom assumes that coupon redemptions are greatest in the period immediately following the coupon drop and decline monotonically. Using regret theory, the authors predict that expiration dates induce a second mode in the redemption pattern just prior to the expiration date.

"Nowadays, the objective of all organizations is to achieve higher market share by recognizing the customer requirements and try to offer the products or services according to these requirements. Financial and credit institutes like banks try to follow these objectives as well. Conjoint analysis ( CA) method is one of the statistical methods which widely used in the marketing problems like prediction of customer behaviors and evaluation of customers' utility of a special service or product. In spite of other methods directly evaluating product preferences, CA helps the organizations to measure the degree of importance of each product or service from general assessment of that product or service by an analytical approach. One of the services of banks is presenting the credit cards to their customers. In Iran, credit cards have been introduced to customers in the recent years. Regarding to improving market of credit cards in Iran, research on identification of Iranian customers' expectations and preferences in use of credit cards is so necessary.

"The authors assumed that automatic preferences based on lowerorder affective processes have a greater impact on choice when people focus on their affective response to choice options (affective focus) than when they try to find reasons for their preferences (cognitive focus). They further supposed that the impact of the focus during decision making is less important when the cognitive resources of consumers are constrained. In an experiment, participants had to choose between two options while the cognitive or affective focus and processing resources were manipulated. Measures of automatic preferences correlated with choice under an affective, but not under a cognitive, focus. In contrast to expectations, this effect of focus was not moderated by the manipulation of processing resources. Interestingly, the automatic measures contributed to the prediction of choice under an affective focus independently and apart from self-report measures.

"Purpose This paper aims to examine how, why and when incidental curiosity might have an influence on consumers' unhealthy eating behaviors in a subsequent, irrelevant context. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted. Study 1 tested the basic main effect; Study 2 further tested the proposed process; Study 3 identified an important moderator and offered additional support for the mechanism. Findings Study 1 demonstrated the basic main effect that incidental curiosity increases consumers' preference for unhealthy food. Study 2 replicated the effect in a simulated grocery-shopping task and further provided direct process evidence that a reward-approaching orientation underlies the effect of curiosity on unhealthy food choice. Finally, Study 3 identified information nature as an important moderator of the effect. That is, when people are curious about threatening information, they are likely to adopt an avoidance motivation, which prevents them from seeking any unhealthy food. Originality/value This research contributes to the curiosity literature by demonstrating that incidental curiosity could have motivational impacts in the non-information domain, such as food choice. It also adds to the food decision literature by documenting incidental curiosity as an important situational factor of consumers' food decisions.","Wang, C",Tactical,10.1108/JCM-08-2018-2835,Healthy eating; Incidental curiosity; Information threat; Reward-approaching,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the effects of incidental curiosity on consumers' unhealthy eating behaviors, which can be interpreted as a specific target within the broader strategic goal of influencing consumer food choices.

"The authors study how strangers become friends within an evolving online social network. By modeling the coevolution of individual users' friendship tie formations (when and with whom) and their concurrent online activities, the authors uncover important drivers underlying individuals' friendship decisions and, at the same time, quantify the resulting peer effects on individuals' actions. They estimate their model using a novel data set capturing the continuous development of a network and users' entire action histories within the network. The results reveal that similarity (homophily) with a potential friend, the properties of a potential friend's network, and the potential friend's domain expertise all play a role in friendship formation. Via prediction exercises, the authors find that stimulating anime watching is the most effective sitewide intervention, which leads to the highest overall site traffic and the largest number of active users, and that recommending a friend of a friend as a potential friend is the most effective strategy in stimulating friendship tie formation. In contrast to the common finding for static networks, the results indicate that seeding to users with the most friends is not the most effective strategy to increase users' activity levels in an evolving network.","Ameri, M; Honka, E; Xie, Y",Tactical,10.1177/00222437221107900,social network formation; product adoption; user-generated content; peer effects,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The study focuses on specific strategies for friendship formation within an online social network, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"We propose a new approach to simulate the likelihood of the sequential search model. By allowing search costs to be heterogeneous across consumers and products, we directly compute the joint probability of the search and purchase decisions when consumers are searching for the idiosyncratic preference shocks in their utility functions. Under the assumptions of Weitzman's sequential search algorithm, the proposed procedure recursively makes random draws for each quantity that requires numerical integration while enforcing the conditions stipulated by the algorithm. In an extensive simulation study, we compare the proposed method with existing likelihood simulators that have recently been used to estimate the sequential search model. The proposed method attributes the uncertainty in the search order to the consumer-product-level distribution of search costs and the uncertainty in the purchase decision to the distribution of match values across consumers and products. This results in more precise estimation and an improvement in prediction accuracy. We also show that the proposed method allows for different assumptions on the search cost distribution and that it recovers consumers' relative preferences even if the utility function and/or the search cost distribution is mis-specified. We then apply our approach to online search data from Expedia for field-data validation. From a substantive perspective, we find that search costs and position effects affect products in the lower part of the product listing page more than they do those in the upper part of the page.","Chung, JH; Chintagunta, P; Misra, S",Tactical,10.1007/s11129-024-09281-4,Simulated maximum likelihood; Consumer search; Sequential search; Search cost; C51; D43; D83; M3,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a method for simulating search model likelihoods, which directly relates to structured decision-making and targeting in marketing analytics and consumer behavior.

"The sudden urge to buy, referred to as impulsive buying, is triggered by both a gamut of extraneous, market-related stimuli and internal psychological factors. The extant literature on this has majorly focused on the antecedents of impulsive shopping, prominent among these include traits (like sensation-seeking and impulse buying tendency or IBT), motives (utilitarian, hedonic), shoppers' resources (time and money), and marketing stimuli. Although personality is a key determinant of consumer decision-making, the role of personality traits, specially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, in impulse buying is not conclusive. Also, there exists a need for analysing impulse buying behaviour with respect to product-specific situations rather than general IBT. The present study fills this gap by analysing the role of three personality traits on impulse buying. A scenario-based online experiment was conducted, and the sample respondents were randomly categorised into two groups. The former group had respondents with an instrument to measure their IBT in general, while the later had respondents for whom the instrument was shared with a scenario built around the product category of apparel. With the data set of 386 respondents, the study reveals that the relationships between the two personality traits-extraversion and neuroticism, and IBT-are independent of the product category. However, the influence of conscientiousness on impulsive buying tendency depends on the product category. The study concludes with managerial implications.","Parsad, C; Prashar, S; Vijay, TS",Tactical,10.21315/aamj2019.24.2.3,extraversion; impulse buying; neuroticism; conscientiousness; impulsive buying tendency,5.0,,15,0,PENERBIT UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA,"The abstract discusses the analysis of personality traits and their impact on impulsive buying behavior, which aligns with the tactical decision-making level focused on structured approaches to marketing strategies and consumer behavior analysis.",wos-prediction,10,70,COMPARING BETWEEN PRODUCT-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL IMPULSE BUYING TENDENCY: DOES SHOPPERS' PERSONALITY INFLUENCE THEIR IMPULSE BUYING TENDENCY?,2019
"Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to predict the success possibility of supply chain practices (SCPs) implementation based on ten selected SCPs using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted, and for the same, data were collected from two organizations. The data collected from both the organizations were analyzed using AHP. The pair-wise comparisons of SCPs (usually, alternatives and attributes) are established using a scale indicating the strength with which one SCP dominates another with respect to higher-level SCPs. This scaling process then translated into priority weights. Once the priority weights of the elements/determinants of the module have been calculated, the presence of the corresponding element in the organization was evaluated. An evaluation rating of these elements multiplied by the established priority weights have determined the prediction weight for each SCP. Findings - The application of this procedure is described for the institutionalization module and can be similarly extended to the other SCPs/SCM implementation modules. By establishing the prediction weight for each module, the organizations will be able to evaluate the strength of the corresponding factors present before embarking on the SCPs. The organization can identify and create awareness of the essential elements in the SCPs implementation process and identify the actions necessary before implementing SCPs. The AHP can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation, especially for medium-and large-scale organizations. Research limitations/implications - The priority weights are subjective and assigned as per the judgment of SCM managers from both the organizations. Further, the priority weights can be obtained from more industry experts through a questionnaire. Second, in this model, only ten practices are taken into consideration for successful SCPs implementation; more practices may be included in future research. Practical implications - The methodological approach presented can be a useful guide in the decision-making process of SCPs implementation in an organization. The outcome will aid practitioners to know the SCPs and benchmark the organizations on the basis of the methodological research conducted. Again, this model can simply act as a possible research model and the data can act as an example that can be utilized for other studies. Originality/value - This is the first kind of study which identified ten SCPs and further deployed AHP approach to see the success possibility of combined SCPs that influence the SCM implementation in an organization.","Gorane, S; Kant, R",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-05-2014-0098,AHP; Case study; Supply chain management; Supply chain practices,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper focuses on predicting the success of supply chain practices (SCPs) implementation, which involves structured decision-making based on priority weights and evaluations of factors.

"Research on the effects of ethical attributes has recently gained traction. However, limited research has addressed consumer response to ethical attributes in the current context where product ratings have become of primary importance to make decisions. Specifically, this study examines the relative effect of ethical attributes on product evaluations across different product ratings. Building on cue consistency theory and the negativity bias, we suggest that ethical attributes gain weight when consumers evaluate a low-rated product. This process leads consumers to anticipate more warm-glow feelings, generating better evaluations for such low-rated products featuring an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute). Two experiments provide consistent empirical support for this prediction, and demonstrate that, compared to other attributes or no attribute, an ethical attribute increases product evaluations to a larger extent when the product received low (vs. higher) ratings. We show that this effect occurs because of warm-glow feelings: when product ratings are low, consumers anticipate more warm-glow feelings from purchasing a product with an ethical attribute (vs. another type of attribute), leading to better product evaluations. These findings have direct managerial and ethical implications for practitioners.","Bezençon, V; Girardin, F; Lunardo, R",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21403,cue consistency; ethical attribute; ethical product; negativity bias; product ratings; sustainable attribute; sustainable product; warm-glow feelings,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the effects of ethical attributes on product evaluations, specifically how these attributes influence consumer decision-making based on product ratings.

"In the last few decades, scholars and practitioners have increasingly tried to understand the factors that influence technology acceptance. Theories and models developed by scholars have tended to focus on the role of cognition and have rarely included affect. The few studies that have incorporated affect have tended to measure a single emotion rather than modeling it comprehensively. This research addresses that inadequacy in our understanding of technology adoption by merging two previously unrelated models: TAM (the Technology Acceptance Model) and PAD (the Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance paradigm of affect). This study also examines an enhanced view of cognition. The product of this unified theoretical framework is referred to as the Consumer Acceptance of Technology (CAT) model. The results of a test using structural equation modeling provide empirical support for the model. Overall, the CAT model explains over 50% of the variance in consumer adoption intentions, a considerable increase compared to TAM. These findings suggest that substantial improvement in the prediction of technology adoption decisions is possible by use of this model with its integration of affect and cognition.

"Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves curves calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time intervals across a fixed horizon of 478 managerial decision makers, self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology. A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years. The results hold great promise for further research on using and optimizing cumulative timed intent measures across a variety of application domains.","Van Ittersum, K; Feinberg, FM",Tactical,10.1509/jmkr.47.5.808,self-reported intentions; cumulative timed intent; technology adoption; predictive accuracy; hierarchical Bayes,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses empirical studies on measuring behavioral intent related to technology adoption over time, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.

"This paper extends the scanner-based choice literature by explicitly incorporating individual-level brand-preference data. We illustrate our model using a unique data set that combines survey and scanner data collected from the same individuals. The addition of individual-specific brand-preference information significantly improves fit and prediction. Furthermore, this observed heterogeneity better explains choice than does unobserved heterogeneity in the standard scanner model's parameters. More importantly, we find that the standard model underestimates the importance of consumers' brand preferences and overestimates both brand loyalties and price sensitivities. Brand loyalty is overestimated because models without preference information confound state dependence, heterogeneity, and preference effects. Price sensitivities are inflated because the average preference-based consumer is implicitly assumed to be more willing to switch from his preferred brand than is the real preference-based consumer. Further, standard models overestimate the heterogeneity in price and loyalty sensitivities and misidentify both price- and loyalty-sensitive consumers. The managerial implications of our findings and the applicability of our methodology when survey data are collected infrequently and for only a subsample of consumers are pursued. We demonstrate that even under these circumstances better populationwide pricing and promotion decisions are identified and more accurate targeting results.","Horsky, D; Misra, S; Nelson, P",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1050.0192,discrete choice; heterogeneity; scanner data,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a model that improves marketing decision-making by incorporating individual-level brand preferences, which aligns with tactical marketing analytics and customer targeting strategies.",wos-prediction,10,70,Observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity in brand-choice models,2006
"Sampling provides limited experience with an offering to promote its purchase, either now or later. Sampling involves an ongoing choice about whether to buy the sampled option. We propose that ongoing choice feels more like a choice when people consider opportunity costs. Consequently, we predict that opportunity cost consideration will accentuate the impact of ongoing choosing on enjoyment over time of the sampled option (i.e., a slope effect). It follows that when ongoing decision evolves toward not choosing the sampled option today, its negative impact on enjoyment should become more pronounced when people consider their opportunity costs, decreasing overall enjoyment. Studies 1, 2, and 3 provided support for this key prediction. Studies 4 and 5 showed that when the best alternative use of a resource people considered was more attractive, they experienced accelerated satiation from an unchosen sampled option. While previous research showed that opportunity cost consideration accentuated the impact of one-time choice on evaluation (i.e., intercept effect), we showed that it accentuated the impact of ongoing choice on enjoyment over time (i.e., slope effect). We also contribute to the understanding of the factors that increase overall enjoyment of a sampling experience, which should influence future purchase likelihood.","Bilgin, B; Lefkeli, D",Tactical,10.1002/mar.21836,enjoyment; financial constraints; ongoing choice; opportunity costs; sampling; satiation,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses how ongoing choices and opportunity costs affect consumer enjoyment and purchasing decisions, which aligns with the tactical level of marketing focused on structured decision-making and consumer engagement strategies.",wos-prediction,10,70,To neglect or to consider?

"This paper tests a theory of strategic multi-product choice (SMPC) using empirical evidence from a large-scale choice experiment, two smaller longitudinal choice experiments, and multi-market panel data. Multi-product choice involves two stages. In the first stage, the consumer chooses a set of substitutable products, where set refers to both the variety of alternatives and the quantities of each. In the second stage, the set is consumed. Assuming consumers are strategic, their consumption decisions will consider both the utility of whichever product is selected for consumption and the expected utility (i.e., value) of the set that remains. SMPC therefore requires a dynamic model. We test two such dynamic models in this paper. These models are derived from a basic random utility framework with a stochastic error term for the utility of each product alternative at the moment of consumption. Despite maintaining state variables for the quantity of every alternative, these SMPC dynamic models offer both a value function and optimal consumption policy in closed form. These structures allow us to test for strategic consumption in the second stage and for optimality of the choice sets selected in the first stage. Data from the large-scale choice experiment and the smaller longitudinal choice experiments support strategic consumer decision-making, consistent with SMPC theory. SMPC theory further predicts that the amount of variety consumers select will be higher for lower consumption rates and lower for higher consumption rates. Evidence from panel data of yogurt purchases supports this prediction. While we find that consumption choices are consistent with SMPC theory, they are not consistent with alternative explanations such as variety seeking or diversification bias. Viewed in its entirety, the empirical evidence presented in this paper confirms that both the choice set selected and the way it is consumed are consistent with dynamic models of future preference uncertainty.","Fox, EJ; Pulgar, H; Semple, JH",Strategic,10.1007/s11129-024-09280-5,Multi-product choice; Dynamic programming; Discrete choice modeling; M310,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses a theory related to strategic multi-product choice (SMPC) that involves long-term consumer decision-making and the implications of these choices on future consumption patterns.

"To estimate customer demand, choice models rely both on what the individuals do and do not purchase. A customer may not purchase a product because it was not offered but also because it was not considered. To account for this behavior, existing literature has proposed the so-called consider-then-choose (CTC) models, which posit that customers sample a consideration set and then choose the most preferred product from the intersection of the offer set and the consideration set. CTC models have been studied quite extensively in the marketing literature. More recently, they have gained popularity within the operations management (OM) literature to make assortment and pricing decisions. Despite their richness, CTC models are difficult to estimate in practice because firms typically do not observe customers' consideration sets. Therefore, the common assumption in OM has been that customers consider everything on offer, so the consideration set is the same as the offer set. This raises the following question: When firms only collect transaction data, do CTC models provide any predictive advantage over classic choice models? More precisely, under what conditions do CTC models outperform (if ever) classic choice models in terms of prediction accuracy? In this work, we study a general class of CTC models. We propose techniques to estimate these models efficiently from sales transaction data. We then compare their performance against the classic approach. We find that CTC models outperform standard choice models when there is noise in the offer set information and the noise is asymmetric across the training and test offer sets but otherwise lead to no particular predictive advantage over the classic approach. We also demonstrate the benefits of using CTC models in real-world retail settings. In particular, we show that CTC models calibrated on retail transaction data are better at long-term and warehouse level sales forecasts. We also evaluate their performance in the context of an online platform setting: a peer-to-peer car sharing company. In this context, offer sets are even difficult to define.

"Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of firm characteristics and crisis characteristics on remedies offered to consumers by firms in the event of a product recall crisis. Design/methodology/approach Published data on 868 product recalls in the US toy industry from 1988 to 2011 have been used to investigate the effects of firm experience in product recalls, type of firm (company versus intermediary) and product recall severity in predicting remedies offered to consumers in the event of a product recall. Findings The findings show that firm recall experience, firm type and recall severity are negatively associated with recall remedies offered. Specifically, firms offer lower remedies if they have higher recall experience, if they are upstream firms in the supply chain (farther from consumers) and if the recall is more severe. Research limitations/implications - This study focuses on the toy industry and does not consider product complexity, firm reputation and the role of external regulatory agencies in the prediction of remedies offered by firms. Future research may extend this study to include the above factors. Practical implications - Offering a high remedy to consumers of a recalled product may be a responsible decision by a firm, but it may also attract shareholder wrath.

"Academic work on sales compensation plans features agency models prominently, and these models have also been used to build decision aids for managers. However, empirical support remains sketchy. We conducted three experiments to investigate three unresolved predictions involving the incentive-insurance trade-off posited in the model. First, compensation should be less incentive loaded with greater effort-output uncertainty so as to provide additional insurance to a risk-averse agent. Second, flat wages should be used for verifiable effort so as to avoid unnecessary incentives. Third, less incentive-loaded plans should be used with more risk-averse agents so as to provide additional insurance. Our design implemented explicit solutions from a specific agency model, which offers greater internal validity, compared to extant laboratory designs that either did not implement explicit solutions or excluded certain parameters. In Experiment I, data from working manager subjects supported the first prediction but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. We interpret this as disclosing the model's core circumstance, wherein it orders the data when the incentive-insurance trade-off is relevant. Thus, when verifiable effort made incentives moot, as is the case for the second prediction, the model failed to order the data. Building on these results, we reasoned that the third prediction should find support among risk-averse agents but not among risk-neutral agents, because insurance is a moot point with the latter agents. To this end, we added risk-neutral utility functions for agents in Experiment II. Data from MBA-candidate student subjects supported the predictions, but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. In those cells in which the incentive-insurance trade-off was moot (either because of risk-neutrality or else verifiability), the data did not support the predictions. We confronted several validity threats to these results. To begin, Experiment I used the standard agency solution, which equalizes an agent's expected utility from the predicted plan with his expected utility from rejecting it. Subjects might have broken these ties on such grounds as fairness. To assess whether this confounded the results, we derived new solutions in Experiment II that broke ties in favor of the predicted plan (by a 10% margin in the expected utility). Our results were robust to this change. Second, our agents' behavior in Experiments I and II was much more consistent with predictions, compared to the principals' behavior, which brought up task comprehension as a validity threat because our principals faced a more complex experimental task than the agents. To address this threat, we used three decision rounds in Experiment III to reduce the principals' task comprehension problems. A related validity threat arose from the relatively small gap in some cells between a principal's predicted expected utility and the principal's next best choice. To address this threat, we derived new solutions with larger gaps to make the principal's choices easier. The results were again robust to these changes, which removes these validity threats. We also addressed two alternative explanations. Might principals be predisposed to pick salary plus commission plans regardless of the model's predictions? If so, we should find such plans chosen uniformly across different experimental conditions. Pooling the data from our three experiments, we rejected this predisposition explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with treatment differences across cells. Second, might agents choose higher effort levels because of a demand bias? If so, we should find agents picking high effort regardless of the plan actually offered to them. Using pooled data, we rejected this explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with a utility-maximizing reaction to the plan actually offered to them. Finally, we included manipulation checks to assess whether principals and agents perceived experimental stimuli identically, as per the common knowledge assumption in game theory. These data showed no differences between agents' and principals' perceptions of stimuli. Our experiments move the literature from simply asking whether the model works to pinpointing the circumstances in which it orders behavior. The primary stylized fact we uncovered is the persistent and striking lack of support for the agency model outside of the circumstance in which risk-averse agents undertake nonverifiable effort. The model's failure when there is no material insurance-incentive tradeoff deserves scrutiny in future work.","Ghosh, M; John, G",Not identified,10.1287/mksc.19.4.348.11792,experimental economics; agency theory; sales compensation; salesforce,65.0,,10,5,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses agency models and empirical investigations related to sales compensation plans, which do not fit cleanly into the categories of strategic, tactical, or operational marketing decisions.

"Avatars, as virtual humans possessing realistic faces, are increasingly used for social and economic interaction on the Internet. Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.","Riedl, R; Mohr, PNC; Kening, PH; Davis, FD; Hekeren, HR",Not identified,10.2753/MIS0742-1222300404,agent; avatar; brain; cognitive neuroscience; evolutionary psychology; evolution theory; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); medial frontal cortex (MFC); mentalizing; NeuroIS; theory-of-mind (TOM),60.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the perception of trust in human vs. avatar interactions but does not clearly fit into strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing.

"Customer base analysis is a key element in customer valuation and can provide guidance for decisions such as resource allocation. Yet extant models often focus on a single activity, such as purchases from a retailer or donations to a nonprofit organization. These models do not consider other ways that an individual may engage with an organization, such as purchasing in multiple brands or contributing user-generated content. In this research, we propose a framework to generalize extant models for customer base analysis to multiple activities. Using the data from a website that allows users to purchase digital content and/or post digital content at no charge, we develop a flexible buy 'til you die model to empirically examine how the two activities are related. Compared with benchmarks, our model more accurately forecasts the future behavior for both types of activities. In addition to finding evidence of coincidence between the activities while customers are alive, we find that the latent attrition processes are related. This suggests that conducting one type of activity is informative of whether customers are still alive to conduct another type of activity and, consequently, affects inferences of customer value.","Schweidel, DA; Park, YH; Jamal, Z",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2013.0832,customer base analysis; latent changepoint model; multivariate choice model; multivariate buy 'til you die model; digital content,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a framework for analyzing customer behavior across multiple activities, implying structured decision-making to optimize resource allocation and customer engagement strategies.

"The literature has identified factors that determine the favorable evaluation of a new brand extension, such as sharing a common product category or providing similar core benefits as the parent brand. However, there has been little research on which of these factors has a greater impact on consumer evaluation. This study explores how self-regulatory focus moderates the relative impacts of benefit overlap (i.e., the consistency of core benefits provided by extensions) versus product category similarity (i.e., the similarity among product categories that include the extensions) on brand extension evaluations. The results of an experiment support the prediction that benefit overlap extensions have greater significance for promotion-focused consumers, whereas category similarity extensions are favored by prevention-focused consumers.","Chang, CC; Lin, BC; Chang, SS",Tactical,10.1007/s11002-010-9131-0,Self-regulatory focus; Brand extension; Benefit overlap; Product category similarity,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The study explores specific factors that influence consumer evaluations of brand extensions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"The benefits of retaining customers have led companies to search for means of profiling their customers individually and tracking their retention and defection behaviors. To this end, the main issues addressed in customer base analysis are identification of customer active/inactive status and prediction of future purchase levels. We compare the predictive performance of Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models from the customer base analysis literature-in terms of repeat purchase levels and active status - using grocery retail transaction data. We also modify the BG/NBD model to incorporate zero repeat purchasers. All models capture the main characteristics of the purchase and dropout process of individual customers and produce similar forecasts. There are some deviations in the cumulative purchase estimates of the models, which may be due to the characteristics of grocery purchasing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"This article explores the theoretical underpinnings of the dissonance framework in online consumer satisfaction formation process. Specifically, we suggest that any discrepancy between pre- and post-purchase service performance would help determine consumers' evaluations of online vendors. Drawing upon cognitive dissonance theory, a conceptual model is developed and tested in two different studies (preliminary and main studies). Using data from 191 college students collected longitudinally, the preliminary study demonstrates the validity and reliability of the measurements. Using a comparative analysis, the main study then tests our conceptual model as well as various competing models, including the expectation-confirmation model, with a sample of 292 online consumers. The results in both studies support our main prediction that the service encountered in different stages establishes dissonance. Specifically, we find that dissonance explains online consumers' satisfaction process to a substantial extent, as compared with disconfirmation under the same conditions in online retailers. This study contributes to providing an alternative yet substantial approach for expectation-confirmation theory, reflecting the overarching nature of online shopping.","Park, I; Cho, J; Rao, HR",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12176,Dissonance; Disconfirmation; Pre- and Post-Purchase Service Performance; customer satisfaction; Comparative Analyses,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The article focuses on understanding consumer satisfaction in online shopping through a theoretical model based on cognitive dissonance theory, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to marketing strategies and customer engagement.",wos-prediction,10,70,The Dynamics of Pre- and Post-purchase Service and Consumer Evaluation of Online Retailers: A Comparative Analysis of Dissonance and Disconfirmation Models,2015

"Purpose This paper aims to attempt to examine the effect of firm-customer exchange characteristics, frequency and specificity, on the likelihood of the firm to generate customer-driven innovation. The authors draw from social capital theory and argue that repetitive and customer-specific exchange improves the trusts between firm and customers, which in turn ease the flows of tacit knowledge from customers to the firm. From the perspective of customer knowledge management, the authors contribute by examining the mechanism by which a firm can acquire knowledge from and about customers. The authors further argue that a firm's ability to absorb knowledge from customers and turn them into innovation also depends on its internal capability. A firm that consistently upgrades its capacity is more likely to generate customer-driven innovation than those that do not. Also, the authors argue that the joint effect of exchange characteristics and internal capability upgrading can further increase the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Such a joint force implies the positive moderating effect of internal capability upgrading to the relationship between exchange characteristics and customer-driven innovation. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the hypotheses on 3,000 firms from six countries in Latin America. They take advantage of the 2017 World Bank Enterprises Survey. This most recent of the survey asks questions on various types of innovation and firm-customers exchange characteristics and other firm-level variables. Findings The authors find support for our hypotheses that repeated exchange and exchanges tailored to specific customers have a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. Also, they find the support that internal capability upgrading, in the form of investment in product design, marketing and organizational development has a positive effect on customer-driven innovation. The authors also find that investment in product design positively moderates the impact of exchange characteristics on the likelihood of customer-driven innovation. Originality/value While past studies focus on strategies to acquire and manage customers' knowledge, little has been said about how exchange attributes can encourage or discourage innovation? This question is important because various theoretical perspectives may have a different prediction on the effect of firm-customer relationship and innovation. This study attempts to bridge such theoretical tension.","Nuruzzaman, N; Singh, D",Strategic,10.1108/JKM-07-2018-0447,Knowledge management; Resources and capabilities; Innovation performance; Customer driven innovation; Exchange relationships,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of firm-customer exchange characteristics on customer-driven innovation, which aligns with strategic planning and goal definition for organizations.",wos-prediction,70,20,"Exchange characteristics, capability upgrading and innovation performance: evidence from Latin America",2019
"Given curiosity's characterization as a motivational drive for knowledge, prior research has primarily focused on curiosity's positive effects on knowledge exploration, information acquisition, and learning. Once the desired knowledge has been acquired, curiosity is said to be satisfied. But what happens if curiosity is left unsatisfied? Across five experiments, spanning four domains of indulgence-related decisions and relying on different methods of curiosity elicitation, the present research sheds light on an unexpected yet crucial consequence of curiosity-that unsatisfied curiosity tempts indulgent consumption in domains unrelated to the source of the curiosity. This effect is explained by a generalized desire for rewards. Experiments 1-3 establish and replicate the proposed mediation model of curiosity -> desire for rewards -> indulgence, employing manipulation-of-process, moderation-of-process, and measurement-of-process experimental designs. Experiment 4 utilizes neurophysiological data to indicate brain activation in the insular cortex for unsatisfied (vs. satisfied) curiosity. Experiment 5 addresses the role of cognitive depletion as a possible alternative mechanism. In summary, this article demonstrates that the hunger for information that accompanies unsatisfied curiosity is converted into a generalized desire for rewards, which in turn tempts indulgence.","Wiggin, KL; Reimann, M; Jain, SP",Not identified,10.1093/jcr/ucy055,curiosity; desire for rewards; indulgent consumption; consumer neuroscience; fMRI; insula; multimethod mediation,55.0,,5,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"The abstract discusses the effects of unsatisfied curiosity on indulgent consumption, which does not clearly align with any of the defined strategic, tactical, or operational categories related to marketing decisions.

"Although personality is a key determinant of consumer purchasing decision making, the role of personality traits in impulse buying and variety seeking is not conclusive. This research uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among impulse buying tendency (IBT), variety seeking tendency (VST), and the Big Five personality traits within one integrated framework. Based on data from a nationally representative sample of 1644 Norwegian adults, the results show that while IBT and VST might be correlated, they differ significantly with respect to two major personality aspects: neuroticism and openness to experience. Specifically, the present study indicates that neuroticism predicted IBT positively and VST negatively, while openness was a strong predictor of VST and unrelated to IBT.

"What drives the behavior of consumers when faced with a product-related crisis, such as that involving food contamination or life-threatening design flaws? For both consumers and companies, these crises have become of increasing importance because of the globalization of markets and an increased coverage by the media. Marketers need to understand why and how consumers react to a crisis. We show that by decoupling risk response behavior of consumers into the separate components of risk perception and risk attitude, a more robust conceptualization and prediction of consumers' reactions is possible. Such a framework helps provide answers on how marketers can deal with such types of crises. The merits of this conceptualization are illustrated in two field studies that examine the reactions of German, Dutch, and American consumers to the BSE (mad cow disease) crisis.

"In the standard economic account of consumer behavior the cost of a purchase takes the form of a reduction in future utility when expenditures that otherwise could have been made are forgone. The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate pain of paying, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a double-entry mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paring and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call prospective accounting, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is coupling, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling. Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to the standard prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong debt aversion-that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paring beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, flat-rate pricing schemes such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases. We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60% of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29% of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates). The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call decision efficiency. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or sen iee should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.","Prelec, D; Loewenstein, G",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.17.1.4,,5.0,,10,5,INST OPERATIONS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,"The abstract discusses a theoretical framework (double-entry mental accounting theory) that has implications for consumer behavior and pricing strategies, indicating a long-term strategic approach to understanding consumer preferences and decision-making.",wos-prediction,60,20,The red and the black: Mental accounting of savings and debt,1998
"Manufacturers' returns policies are a common feature in the distribution of many products. The obvious rationale for returns policies is insurance. Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty. We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition. When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case. In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (excessive stocking) of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great. To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U.S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition.","Padmanabhan, V; Png, IPL",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.16.1.81,,10.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of manufacturers' returns policies on retail competition and profitability, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making under uncertainty.",wos-prediction,60,20,Manufacturer's returns policies and retail competition,1997
"Purpose-Business sustainability refers to the total effort of a company including its demand and supply chain networks to reduce the impact on the Earth's life-and eco-systems. The objective of this paper is to describe a business sustainability model based upon a case study of a European manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach A case study approach was applied describing the efforts of business sustainability in the demand and supply chain networks of a Norwegian office chair producer. It is based upon a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews with top executives of the company as well as observations and content analyses of internal and external documents about the company's efforts of business sustainability. Findings-The case study shows that business sustainability is not about doing just one thing, but that a multitude of simultaneous efforts (e.g. actors, resources and activities) should be in place. Furthermore, business sustainability is not only about a company's own business operations, but its whole demand and supply chain networks which need to be included and taken into consideration. Research limitations/implications-The case study in focus is limited to just one company's effort of business sustainability and its demand and supply chain networks. It provides a business sustainability model that offers opportunities for further research. Practical implications-Focusing on the corporate impact of the natural environment can be highly profitable. Business sustainability and by extension the carbon footprint of demand and supply chain networks is becoming a criterion in the decision-making process of customers across industries. Business sustainability is a concern to everybody in society as the indicatives of climate change and global warming become more evident and troublesome. No one can have missed the fact that the weather is becoming more extreme, causing damage around the globe. Originality/value-The authors argue that research into business sustainability needs at this stage of development to be inductive rather than deductive it may be an irreversible mistake to try to re-package existing theory into business sustainability, as climate change prediction and the poor condition of the Earth have not been fully understood or comprised in previous theory.","Hogevold, NM; Svensson, G",Strategic,10.1108/08858621211197001,Business model; Business sustainability; Carbon footprint; Network; Demand chain; Supply chain; Norway; Supply and demand,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,The abstract discusses a business sustainability model and emphasizes the long-term goals of incorporating sustainability into the entire demand and supply chain networks.

"Purpose An intention-behavior gap often occurs for socially responsible consumption, where despite positive consumer attitudes, sales remain disappointing. This paper aims to test the ability of in-store priming to increase sales of local foods vis-a-vis imported, cheaper equivalents. Design/methodology/approach Laboratory and field experiments in three countries (Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia), working with an international grocery retailer, assess the ability of textual and pictorial-based point of sale (PoS) materials to increase the purchase of local foods. Field sales data, for the purchase of local apples and cherries and their imported equivalents, are complemented by an analysis of loyalty card transactions. Findings Field data indicate that both pictorial and textual PoS materials, significantly increase the likelihood of purchasing local foods, against cheaper imported equivalents. Pictorial PoS materials appear more effective than textual equivalents. Laboratory study data indicate that PoS materials increase the salience of goal consistent mechanisms in decision-making at the expense of mechanisms to achieve non-primed goals. Research limitations/implications The field experiment lasted for only two weeks and focused on seasonal produce. Practical implications PoS materials offer a low cost intervention for modifying consumer behavior in stores. Originality/value The paper develops a theory regarding how priming works and its application in a supermarket setting. This is investigated and validated in the context of local foods.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the influence of future anticipation toward the development of brand relationship which finally creates brand loyalty. Brand loyalty has fascinated a number of researchers to conduct studies for so many years; however, its relationship with future anticipation has remained untouched by academia. Design/methodology/approach This study proved the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. The empirical approximated for the main-effects model and model goodness of fit indexes. The results signified a good fit of the data to our conceptual model in both samples. Findings The research shows that the influence of future anticipation is very essential in creating a brand relationship, autobiographical memory or even market performance and all in Asia; also Europe has similar significance with regard to this matter. Thus, it is important for companies to emphasize the importance of future anticipation and also delivers or informs it well to customers to create a positive perception in customers' mind. Originality/value Future anticipation concept is anchored in philosophy theory and psychology. With respect to the study objectives, the focus is on the perspective of time which refers to thought and attitude toward past, present and future.

"Purpose: The foremost objective of this study is to obtain segments/clusters of franchisors that are more likely to fail. A second aim is to evaluate the influence of the usual variables of the franchise contract on the solvency of franchises. Design/methodology/approach: This study set up a database with information collected from several Spanish franchising yearbooks and franchisors' websites to establish the census of Spanish franchisors. This article worked with a census of the franchises operating in Spain from 2001 to 2011. Latent class regression analysis is used. Findings: This research found four segments or classes of franchisors with regard to their failure pattern. In addition, this article defined the most influential variables in the franchisors' risk of failure. The relationships between the variables that define a franchise contract and the Z scores of Altman's model have been extracted. The dependent variable has been the Altman's Z model and the independent variables are those that define the franchise contract. Research implications: This methodology offers potential franchisees a new criterion for assessing the franchise chains they are investigating, taking into account their risk of failure. This allows franchisees to better highlight those franchisors that have a lower crash risk and avoid the damage incurred by the closure of the chain. The information provided for franchisees should be accessible, usable, and suitable to help franchisees to choose the best franchise systems in which to invest. This methodology is of course very useful for franchisors, because they can comprehend their financial situation and how they could manage the franchising variables in order to improve their solvency. Practical implications: All the segments are solvent, except Segment 3. The distinguishing feature of this segment is that over 64 percent of the firms are retailer chains. In addition, more than 20 percent of the franchises from our database are in financial danger, and this is the group where the number of service companies is lower. Originality/value: This research is unique in two ways. First, this study presents a new methodology in this field that allows researchers to use the historical-financial data of franchisors, and the information of the franchise contract to predict franchisor failure. Second, this article helps franchisees to make their own decisions on the basis of the franchisors' level of risk of failure. Third, this research offer a theoretical contribution about franchisor failure, this topic is scarcely treated by academic literature.","Rodríguez-Rad, CJ; Rondán-Cataluña, FJ; Macías-Molina, JA",Strategic,10.1080/1051712X.2018.1381416,Franchising; franchisor; failure; latent class regression; Altman's Z Model,5.0,,10,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The study focuses on understanding franchisor failure and developing a methodology that can inform long-term decisions for franchisees and franchisors alike.

"When judging objects described by incomplete evidence, people often make judgments on the basis of what is known and fail to adjust for what is unknown. However, contextual factors may increase sensitivity to the limited weight of the given information. Consistent with this hypothesis, four experiments show that sensitivity to the limitations of the evidence and the likelihood of judgmental moderation increases when (a) a target is judged in the context of a similar object described on dimensions different from those used to describe the target, or (b) a target is judged in the context of a completely different type of object described by a relatively large amount of information. Considered together, the results suggest that judgment is moderated when contextual objects or cues alert judges to specific omissions or when contextual cues imply a general lack of information. The findings illuminate the diverse effects that even context objects of a different category have on information integration judgment. Context objects may affect the weighting as well as the valuation of the evidence about targets described by limited information and thereby contribute to judgmental moderation. Finally, the findings illustrate the contextually sensitive nature of the weighting criteria that guide information integration.

The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task's perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms' perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.","Castelo, N; Bos, MW; Lehmann, DR",Tactical,10.1177/0022243719851788,algorithms; new products; technology adoption,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses how to increase consumer trust and reliance on algorithms for tasks that may be perceived as subjective, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, particularly in areas like consumer engagement and recommendation systems.",wos-prediction,10,70,Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,2019

In Study 1, the presence of an emotion-eliciting image affected consumer spending on unrelated products in a simulated retail environment. In Study 2, emotional processing ability and whether consumers monitored their feelings moderated emotional transfers between unrelated advertisements, providing support for an affect-as-information model. In Studies 3 and 4, the authors use the context of evaluative conditioning to generalize the incidence of emotional contagion in persuasive communication.

"PurposeThis study aims to endeavor to shed light on the underlying causal mechanisms behind the failure of startups by examining the failure process in such organizations. To achieve this goal, the study conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the definition of failure and its various dimensions, resulting in the compilation of a comprehensive list of causes of startup failure. Subsequently, the failure process was analyzed using a behavioral strategy approach that encompasses rationality, plasticity and shaping, as well as the growth approach of startups based on dialectic, teleology and evolution theories.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed research methodology was a case study using process tracing, with the sample being a failed platform in the ride-hailing technology sector. The causal mechanism was further explicated through the combined application of the behavioral strategy approach and interpretive structural modeling analysis.FindingsThe findings of the study suggest that the failure of startups is a result of interlinked causes and effects, and growth in these organizations is driven by dialectic, teleology and evolution theories.Originality/valueThe outcomes of the research can assist startups in formulating an effective strategy to deliver the right value proposition to the market, thereby reducing the chances of failure.","Sajjadian, F; Amirshahi, M; Abdolvand, N; Hajipour, B; Sana, SS",Strategic,10.1108/JM2-07-2023-0141,Behavioral strategy; Entrepreneurial failure; Organizational growth; Process tracing; Ventures,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms behind startup failures and provides insights that can help formulate long-term strategies for reducing such failures.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents of consumers' attitude towards, and intention to commit, digital piracy in Indonesia, a country with the world's fourth largest population and one of the highest digital piracy rates. This study explored the effects of six variables derived from the theory of planned behaviour, ethics theory, and deterrence theory on young consumers in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach - Using a convenience sampling approach, researchers hand delivered 400 questionnaires to undergraduate students at one large private university and one major public university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Findings - The results showed that consumers' intention to pirate digital products was strongly influenced by consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. Interestingly, fear of legal consequences and perceived likelihood of punishment were not significant predictors of consumers' attitude towards digital piracy. This suggests that the principles of deterrence theory have a limited impact on consumers' attitudes in Indonesia. Originality/value - The results of this study will provide some insights to government and digital industries on how to reduce the prevalence of digital piracy.","Arli, D; Tjiptono, F",Strategic,10.1108/APJML-11-2015-0163,Theory of planned behaviour; Deterrence theory; Digital piracy; Ethics theory,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study examines the antecedents of consumer attitudes and intentions towards digital piracy, which relates to long-term implications for government and digital industries in addressing piracy.

"Many firms use decision tools called automatic recommendation systems that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark models. The author shows that the main model is better than benchmark models on key measures.","Bodapati, AV",Tactical,10.1509/jmkr.45.1.77,customer relationship management; one-to-one marketing; up-selling; cross-selling; automatic recommendation systems; Internet marketing; direct marketing; stochastic choice models; hierarchical Bayes models; dual latent class models,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the modeling of recommendation actions and their impact on customer buying behavior, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing and product development.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Recommendation systems with purchase data,2008
"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this model-based recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%.

"Purpose - To discuss and analyse three themes in qualitative research in marketing which are objects of both frustration and confusion: analysis and interpretation; theory generation; and a quest for scientific pluralism and individual researcher lifestyles. Design/methodology/approach - Underpinning the discussion is that complexity, ambiguity, fuzziness, chaos, change, uncertainty and unpredictability are characteristics of a market economy; that qualitative and subjective interpretation is necessary to add the spark of life to marketing data; and that general marketing theory needs more attention from researchers. Practical implications - The proper use of methodology and the generation of better marketing theory will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions. Findings - Quantitative and qualitative research processes are not by nature antagonistic, although their advocates may be; quantitative methodology carries qualitative bugs, necessary for its sustenance.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate returns to search (getting a better product and/or a lower price as a result of search) when consumers use/do not use recommendation agents (RAs). Specifically, it studies the effect of RAs/no RAs on decision quality, decision confidence and decision satisfaction taking into account subjective knowledge (SK) and involvement. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employed two between-subjects factorial experimental designs with subjects searching for digital cameras in a simulated online digital camera store. The experiment was conducted with graduate students in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mysore in India. Findings - Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers. When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better. Originality/value - The effect of RA vs no RA in conjunction with relevant consumer characteristics influencing decision quality of the consumer is demonstrated in this study. The findings have important managerial, consumer and theoretical contributions to make.","Maheswarappa, SS; Sivakumaran, B; Kumar, AG",Tactical,10.1108/APJML-10-2016-0188,Decision quality; Recommendation agents; Returns to search,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper investigates the effects of recommendation agents on consumer decision-making, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at enhancing consumer engagement and optimizing marketing strategies.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Returns to search when consumers use and do not use recommendation agents,2017
"In this paper we propose a mufti-criteria decision making support system, called a Feedback Based Diagnosis System (FBDS), to aid the marketing team of an e-commerce (EC) organisation in its activities. The FBDS database is composed of customers' satisfaction measures. These measures are related to the different services an EC offers to its customers. Thus, they constitute a mufti-criteria (MC) evaluation of EC performances. In the general framework of recommender systems, these available MC evaluations are considered as useful information for other customers to help them to objectively, rationally and exhaustively assess and compare the numerous ECs among the ones likely to meet their needs. Our FBDS is not concerned with improving or automating such a recommendation process for customers. Indeed, it is merely EC management team oriented. In fact, the MC feedback database is used to diagnose the EC health and improve its strategy. In the proposed FBDS, a possibilistic framework is combined with the multi criteria representation to capture the variability and the divergence of customers' evaluations w.r.t. each criterion. Then, an aggregation based on a weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) is proposed to obtain a synthetic appraisal of ECs. The WAM aggregation models the strategy agreed on by the EC management team. Computing the synthesis score of an EC consists in propagating the uncertainty related to its partial scores through the WAM. The possibilistic representation guarantees that no information is lost in the collective evaluation process by the consumers' community. However, diagnosis indicators are finally proposed to the marketing team to make the interpretation of some possibilistic results more comprehensive when necessary. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the complex role of consumer participation by empirically testing a theoretical model within the online context of consumer using product recommendation agents (RAs) that integrates consumer participation into the technology acceptance model (TAM). Recent research starts questioning whether consumer participation is a double-edged sword, although its positive effects have been widely documented in the services marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 243 respondents comprising both genders with varied age groups, education levels, household income and ethnicities. Participants interacted with an existing RA, searching product information for a simulated purchase involving either high or low financial risk. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equations modeling (SEM) were used for assessing construct validity and testing hypotheses, respectively. Findings - Consumer participation was found to positively affect enjoyment but negatively affect perceived ease of use of an RA, which was exacerbated when the purchase was of high financial risk. Predictions based on TAM were all supported in this study. Research limitations/implications - This research evidenced consumer participation's dual-effect and identified financial risk as a moderator of consumer participation' negative effect. Future research could employ a different design such as using controlled lab settings and conducting longitudinal studies to replicate the study. Practical implications - Findings from this research provide guidance to RA design regarding the amount of consumer participation, consumer perceptions of RA use (ease of use, usefulness and enjoyment) and financial risk involved in the purchase. Originality/value - This research sheds new light on the role of consumer participation through uncovering its dual-effect, thus complementing the services marketing and RA literature.","Sheng, XJ; Zolfagharian, M",Tactical,10.1108/JSM-04-2013-0098,Participation; Technology; Online; Recommendation,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The paper examines consumer participation in product recommendation agents (RAs), focusing on empirical testing that informs design and decision-making at a tactical level.

"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from high-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing.","Guo, F; Zhang, XF; Ding, Y; Wang, XS",Operational,10.1037/npe0000051,recommendation; neural responses; event-related potentials; propensity; value measurement,15.0,,70,0,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"The study examines the cognitive processes related to consumer behavior and decision-making influenced by recommendations in online shopping, which are closely tied to day-to-day operational activities.",wos-recommendation,5,10,Recommendation Influence: Differential Neural Responses of Consumers During Shopping Online,2016
"E-business leverages digital channels to scale its functions and services and operates by connecting and retaining customers using marketing initiatives. To increase the likelihood of a sale, the business must recommend additional items that the customers may be unaware of or may find appealing. Recommender Engine (RE) is considered to be the preferred solution in these cases for reasons that include delivering relevant items, hence improving cart value, and boosting customer engagement. The paper describes a model for delivering real-time, personalised marketing information concerning the recommended items for online and offline customers, using a blend of selling strategies: up-selling, cross-selling, best-in-class-selling, needs-satisfaction-selling and consultative-selling. The model further defines the e-marketplace by clustering items, customers and unique selling proposition (USP), and then gathering, storing, and processing transactional data, and displaying personalised marketing information to support the customer in their decision-making process, even when purchasing from large item spaces. An experimental study using a quantitative research methodology was conducted in a mid-size healthcare retailer, based out of India, to determine the tangible benefits. The model was tested with 100 online customers and, with the adoption of the proposed methodology, the results indicated growth in average monthly revenue (33.49%), Average Order Value (AOV) (32.79%) and Items per Order (IPO) (1.93%).","Behera, RK; Gunasekaran, A; Gupta, S; Kamboj, S; Bala, PK",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.03.026,Personalized digital marketing; Recommender engine; Customer relationship management,5.0,,15,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a model for personalized marketing and sales enhancement through recommendations, which aligns with tactical decision-making focused on achieving specific marketing targets and customer engagement strategies.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Personalized digital marketing recommender engine,2020

Yet, the role of consumer participation in using RAs has not been examined. This study shows that greater consumer participation in using an RA leads to more satisfaction, greater trust, and higher purchase intentions, related to the RA and its recommendations. In contrast, the financial risk (associated with the product under consideration) reduces satisfaction, trust, and purchase intentions, and it also moderates the effect of consumer participation on these same variables.

"In the fiercely competitive landscape of the peer-to-peer accommodation platform Airbnb, understanding customers' online recommendation behavior is essential for optimizing competitiveness and harnessing the potential of electronic word-of-mouth. This study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the factors driving customers' issuance of positive or negative recommendations based on their experiences. Leveraging 10,101 online reviews from Airbnb users, we employ the Structural Topic Model to determine latent topics relating to customers' recommendation intentions. This study reveals that positive recommendations are primarily influenced by hedonic values tied to the overall experience, including crucial aspects such as convenience for exploring points of interest, local authenticity, social interaction, and emotional fulfillment. These findings highlight the significance of providing memorable and enriching experiences to elicit positive reviews from customers. On the other hand, negative recommendations are closely linked to utilitarian values focused on practical concerns such as check -in procedures, cleanliness, comfortableness, and amenities. Understanding these utilitarian factors is vital for hosts and platform administrators to improve service quality and address potential issues that may lead to negative reviews.

"Mobile payment systems offer enormous potential as alternative payment solutions. However, the diffusion of mobile payments over the years has been less than optimal despite the numerous studies that have explored the reasons for its adoption. Consequently, there is an increased interest in exploring alternative actions for promoting its diffusion, especially user recommendation of the technology. This is because positive recommendations can enormously influence the decisions of potential consumers to use the technology while negative recommendations can increase resistance to it. The few extant studies in this domain have followed the traditional survey approach with hypothetic-deductive reasoning, thus limiting an understanding of factors outside their conceptual models that could influence recommendations. To address this shortcoming, this study uses a qualitative text-mining approach that explores themes from user reviews of mobile payment applications (apps). Using 5955 reviews from 16 mobile payment apps hosted on the Google Play store, this study applied the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) text-mining method to extract themes from the reviews that help to explain why users provide positive or negative recommendations about mobile payment systems. A total of 13 themes (i.e. ease of use, usefulness, convenience, security, reliability, satisfaction, transaction speed, time-saving, customer support, output quality, perceived cost, usability and trust) were generated from the LDA model which provides both theoretical and practical insights for advancing mobile payments diffusion and research.","Verkijika, SF; Neneh, BN",Tactical,10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102743,Mobile payment; Text-mining; Positive recommendation; Negative recommendation,5.0,,25,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The study focuses on user recommendations and themes influencing mobile payment adoption, which aligns with tactical decisions aimed at interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights for improving user engagement and technology diffusion.",wos-recommendation,10,60,Standing up for or against: A text-mining study on the recommendation of mobile payment apps,2021
"We introduce a new recommendation technique based on fuzzy concepts such as the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation and the fuzzy market research system approach. The recommendation technique uses general consumer perception about product attributes of multiattributed products such as smartphones as input and gives consumers' sequential preference of the products as output. The recommendation technique explains the power of an attribute in predicting other attributes, especially in fuzzy and uncertain environments, through the conceptualisation of consumers' innate associations between the attributes. Our technique provides an understanding of consumer preference through the articulation of buyers' trade-offs amongst attributes of a product. (c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

"With the rapid development of social commerce, how to push and diffuse marketing messages in online social network (OSN) more effectively has increasingly become a significant issue, which can result in benefits for enterprises, users and platforms. A fundamental solution to this issue is how to accurately and comprehensively model user interest. To resolve such a significant and challenging task, our study constructed a user interest graph represented by a hierarchical tree structure that covers a wide range of topics, from coarse-grained to fine-grained three-level interest topics, such as food, entertainment and shopping, with a total of 167 nodes. In addition, considering that a user's interests are always changing over time, an exponential interest decay scheme is employed in this study. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with three benchmarks designed based on the proposed algorithm and two similar hierarchical user interest models. The experimental results demonstrate our model works well to predict user interests.

"Bias-driven marketing leverages the behavioral biases of investors for greater marketing gains. To transform cognitively biased individuals from antagonists into allies, the marketers need to decipher the critical crowdfunding attributes, which ultimately motivate behaviorally biased crowdfunders to invest in crowdfunding campaigns. Hence, this study seeks to investigate the influential factors concerning four behavioral biases that accelerate crowdfunding adoption. A conceptual model, parameterized using conjoint analysis, is developed and administered in an agent-based behavior model to effectively determine the influential crowdfunding attributes, which will induce the biased investors to adopt crowdfunding. The results revealed that status quo biased individuals adopted the crowdfunding campaign when launched by well-known and reputed fund raisers. Whereas, hyperbolic discounting bias accelerated the adoption when the campaign reached more than 75% of subscription and duration was lesser than 30 days. The results also indicated that framing bias enhanced the adoption when the risk inherent in the project is disclosed. Finally, the results also claimed that individuals liable to loss aversion bias expected a known funder, who posts frequent updates and preferred the All-or-Nothing crowdfunding model. The experimental results of the study provide insights to the marketers that crowdfunding campaigns can be successfully strategized through the exploration of underlying cognitive biases and the corresponding motivational cues that accentuate the pledging behavior of the funders. Given the importance of an effective marketing strategy in crowdfunding adoption, this study offers one such recommendation to the crowdfunding campaigners by demonstrating how bias driven marketing strategy enhances the adoption rate of the campaigns. With the strong pieces of evidence obtained from this study, it is anticipated that behavioral biases, drawn from the neuromarketing theory, will no longer be viewed as cognitive errors from the investor's perspective. Rather, it will be viewed as a boon from the marketer's perspective as the bias-based marketing strategies have the potential to achieve a fully subscribed crowdfunding campaign.","Panneerselvam, T; Arun, CJ",Tactical,10.1111/ijcs.12795,agent based behavior model; behavioral bias; bias driven marketing; crowdfunding adoption; modeling biased funders,0.0,,15,5,WILEY,"The abstract discusses specific strategies related to marketing in crowdfunding, focusing on how to utilize behavioral biases to enhance campaign adoption rates.

Thus, this study explores how the technology acceptance model (TAM) and anxiety regarding the use of VR after virtually visiting a tourist destination influence older adults' intention to reuse VR for tourism. Most importantly, this study examines whether this intention is related to WOM recommendations of a virtually visited tourist destination. Using a combination of quantitative (PLS) and qualitative (thematic analysis) methods, this study uses data gathered from older adults living in four continuing care retirement communities. VR glasses (Oculus Go Standalone) were used to virtually visit the Carnival of Venice. Results show that the TAM factors are key drivers of older adults' use of VR, which in turn influences tourist destination recommendations. Anxiety was found to reduce the VR device's perceived ease of use, but it was not found to be related to perceived usefulness. Implications for practitioners and possible directions for future research are discussed.","Sancho-Esper, F; Ostrovskaya, L; Rodriguez-Sanchez, C; Campayo-Sanchez, F",Tactical,10.1177/13567667221080567,Virtual reality; technology acceptance; destination recommendation; older adults; mixed methods; partial least squares,5.0,,20,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The abstract discusses the exploration of technology acceptance and its implications for older adults' intention to reuse VR for tourism, which aligns with structured decision-making related to marketing strategies and targets.",wos-recommendation,15,60,Virtual reality in retirement communities: Technology acceptance and tourist destination recommendation,2023
"Link structures among items within an E-commerce Web site can be regarded as a potential recommendation that helps new consumers quickly locate relevant products. In this paper, combining a modified version of Google's PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a product's position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers' purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers' purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics.","Hu, N; Tian, GL; Liu, L; Liang, B; Gao, YJ",Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318,Collaborative-filtering cross sale; marketing strategy; online word of mouth (WOM); PageRank; price strategy,5.0,,15,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses how link structures within an E-commerce website influence consumer purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing decisions aimed at optimizing product visibility and recommendations.

"Purpose Grounded in regulatory mode theory (RMT), this study aims to investigate the impact of managers' orientation for action (locomotion and assessment) in business-to-business positioning decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Data are collected using a scenario-based experimental design. Study 1 examines whether interest and involvement in recommending a positioning strategy depends on a manager's regulatory mode orientation. The impact of such orientations on the likelihood of changing a recommended positioning strategy is the focus of Study 2. The moderating effects of task motivation (expected rewards resulting from a recommendation), market feedback and the line manager's leadership style are examined. Findings Both assessment and locomotion are significant determinants of involvement in recommending a positioning strategy. The introduction of motivation as a moderator helps explain differences in level of interest in positioning decision-making. Locomotion, but not assessment, affects the likelihood of changing a recommended positioning strategy. Assessment amplifies the impact of locomotion, while none of the interaction effects between regulatory mode orientation and contextual factors is a significant determinant of changing a positioning strategy. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of RMT on positioning decision-making. Results from two experiments provide novel insights into the predictive relevance of managers' preference in terms of involvement with the decision-making process and the likelihood of altering positioning.","Kalafatis, SP; Blankson, C; Boatswain, ML; Tsogas, MH",Tactical,10.1108/JBIM-04-2019-0145,Experiments; Positioning strategies; Regulatory mode; Positioning decision-making,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study investigates managers' decision-making processes regarding positioning strategies, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into specific targets and structured decisions.",wos-recommendation,10,70,Preference for action: regulatory mode in B2B positioning decision-making,2020
