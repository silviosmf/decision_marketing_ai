"Television advertising effectiveness constitutes a key marketing issue. Advertisers rely on program TV ratings to determine advertisement placement because consumers' decisions to view TV commercials are largely influenced by their TV program-viewing behavior. However, high program viewership of television dramas does not always entail high commercial viewership; consumers' motivations for drama consumption play a critical role. In the context of TV drama viewing, we build a two-stage structural model that distinguishes two motivations for TV drama consumption-viewers' liking for a drama and the need for cognitive closure-and demonstrate their contrasting effects on consumers' commercial-viewing behavior. Although both motivations enhance drama-viewing behavior, consumers exhibit an enhanced (vs. diminished) tendency to watch subsequent commercials when they possess heightened liking for the drama (vs. the need for cognitive closure). These findings contribute to extant research on TV commercial-viewing behavior by distinguishing the roles of different drama-viewing motivations. Based on the model estimation results, we conduct a series of simulation studies to generate rich managerial implications. Managerial practices for both advertisers and TV networks are discussed.","Shi, Y; Wang, TT",Tactical,10.1080/08997764.2021.1883916,,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",The abstract discusses the effectiveness of television advertising and how different motivations for drama consumption influence commercial-viewing behavior.

"PurposeThis paper aims to explore the challenges and opportunities faced by buying centers in small and medium enterprises (SME) manufacturing companies in view of recent technological changes and the virtualization of communication.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a qualitative approach with multiple case studies to portray complex realities within the buying centers in the manufacturing SME context. The authors selected five Italian companies to portray the diverse characteristics, practices and policies of relevant stakeholders before reaching saturation with the issues explored.FindingsThe authors find that interactions among buying center members are more effective with greater collaboration and exchange (as opposed to competition and a struggle for power). Virtual/hybrid relations require greater intra-group cooperation, whereas diverse backgrounds and collaborative interactions help the flexibility and performance of the buying center. Greater use of technology produces certainty and automation, but it may also cause overload and biases that can be solved with the ability to analyze and clear responsibility for decisions.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors studied only five Italian companies in this study. Future research in other countries with diverse cultural and socio-economic conditions and methods would help extend this research.Practical implicationsThe findings would improve the understanding of the challenges of adopting new purchase process technologies that would help automate routine tasks, produce useful data and support decision-making.Originality/valueUnlike prior studies, this study uses an exploratory design to study the evolution of buying centers in SMEs to seek deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by SMEs because of the growing use of emerging technologies.","Cardinali, S; Sharma, P; Cedrola, E; Giovannetti, M; Pillai, KG",Strategic,10.1108/JBIM-03-2023-0157,Buying center; Digital communication; Digital technologies; Hybrid selling,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term challenges and opportunities faced by buying centers in SMEs, including the implications of technological changes and the evolution of communication.

"The pandemic has led to a significant increase in the use of video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Yet little is known about the impact of video conferencing on subsequent consumer decisions. Across six studies, we examine the effects of video conferencing in both consumption (e.g., sales) and nonconsumption (e.g., school and work) contexts and find that video conferencing can trigger greater interest in products that can enhance the self - physically, intellectually, and/or mentally - due to heightened social appearance anxiety. This effect is attenuated when technology allows users to reduce social appearance anxiety (e.g., the use of ring lights or the ability to turn off web cameras) but accentuated when social anxiety is increased (e.g., the use gallery/ speaker views) and is more pronounced among consumers who are low in self-esteem.

"PurposeAmid challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, fostering employee creativity has become paramount for organizations. However, there is a scarcity of research on digitalization of the workplace and its implications for implementing high involvement work systems (HIWSs) in organizations, particularly in relation to their impact on employee outcomes, such as creativity and job satisfaction. Additionally, limited attention has been given to the role of job level and organizational type in driving change during times of adversity. This study aims to examine the factors within the HIWSs model using the PIRK model - power (P), information sharing (I), rewards (R) and knowledge (K) to explore how HIWSs shape the extent of power individuals have over their employment, the sharing of information, the types of rewards that engage and motivate employees and the knowledge required to fulfil employees' responsibilities effectively, both individually and collectively.Design/methodology/approachUsing a qualitative research methodology, this study uses thematic analysis for data collection, analysis and interpretation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 48) served as the primary data collection method. Using the theoretical lenses of high-involvement practices and employee perceptions of PIRK, the effect on employee creativity and job satisfaction is analysed.FindingsThe findings of this study reveal that employee creativity is significantly influenced by how employees perceive power, information, rewards and knowledge. Moreover, the study highlights the role of transformational and transactional leadership in shaping employee perceptions of power, information and knowledge within HIWSs. A high perception of PIRK is found to positively impact employee job satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study offers valuable insights for human resource management (HRM) professionals seeking to make informed decisions regarding best practices and initiatives for enhancing employee outcomes in the post-COVID era. By recognizing the pivotal role of HIWSs and their influence on employee perceptions, organizations can strategically implement HIWSs to foster creativity and job satisfaction. Furthermore, this research contributes to the existing literature by examining the interplay between HIWSs and the PIRK model in the context of workplace digitalization, emphasizing the importance of adapting HRM practices to address the evolving needs of the modern workforce.Originality/valueThis study will help HRM professionals in making informed decisions on the best practices and initiatives to enhance employee outcomes in the post-COVID era.

"New technologies create novel tensions, such as between providing consumers with greater control over their personal data and enhancing the technological sophistication of firms' offerings (e.g., through automation). Resolving such control-related tensions requires specific, comprehensive conceptualizations and measures of consumers' perceived data control. Drawing from conceptual notions of control, the authors develop a novel, multistage account of control across consumer-firm data exchanges in various traditional (active and passive) and new, hybrid data disclosure settings. By distinguishing, defining, and operationalizing control activities pertaining to the collection, submission, access, and use of personal data, this article proposes a means to capture consumers' subjective control perceptions. Study 1, focused on quantitative measure validation, establishes that consumers can distinguish the four data control activities; Study 2, a qualitative account using depth interviews, reveals that consumers identify the four control activities unprompted and across diverse situations. Collectively, these findings present both theoretical and practical implications. This article concludes with a robust set of research directions for an expanded understanding of data control activities in technology-mediated environments. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

"Sharing economy is flourishing and increasingly customers are shifting towards using instead of owning products and services. The objective of our research is to empirically prove that low organizational trust can trigger strict organizational practices such as ethics training and audits but excessive use of both of these practices can negatively impact the relationship quality in sharing economy. In doing so, it has detrimental effects on co-creation and co-innovation particularly when the goals are related to emotional cognitive, material support and relationship building. This study, therefore, targets to scrutinize the dark side of B2B sharing economy platforms using the ethical theory of organizing. The unique contribution of this study is first, showcasing the relationships between ethical climate, ethical practices and consequences. Second, it highlights that B2B alliances that perceive strictness in ethics audits have a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. However, the effect of strictness in ethics training does not lead to the development of a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. This is an interesting finding and generates a theoretical debate. The findings of the study will promote the development of an ethical model that addresses the negative aspects of the B2B sharing economy.","Bag, S; Gupta, S; Srivastava, G; Sivarajah, U; Kumar, A",Strategic,10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.08.019,B2B; Sharing economy platform; Value co-creation; Co-innovation; Ethics training; Ethics audit,3.0,,10,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of organizational trust and ethical practices within the sharing economy, focusing on how these factors influence relationship quality and co-creation.

"The adoption of digital technologies in the modern business world stays fast-moving, and managers underutilize the huge potentials entailed by digitalization. Literature concerning labor market developments proposes an assessment on work-task level, to evaluate job automation susceptibility. The paper is based on this approach and further extends and details the existing models for the determination of efficiency potentials in the field of marketing and sales. Using a qualitative research design, a new descriptive model for tasks is first developed. Based on this, a second model for calculating efficiency potentials is derived in the next steps integrating data from ONET database.","Goldmann, S; Knoerzer, M",Tactical,10.1002/mde.3793,,5.0,,10,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,"The abstract discusses the development of models to evaluate job automation susceptibility and efficiency potentials in marketing and sales, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets.",wos-automation,15,70,Technology advancement propels work productivity: Empirical efficiency potential determination in marketing and sales,2023
"We propose a human-machine hybrid approach to automating decision making in high human-interaction environments and apply it in the business-to-business (B2B) retail context. Using sales transactions data from a B2B aluminum retailer, we create an automated version of each salesperson, which learns and automatically reapplies the salesperson's pricing policy. In a field experiment with the B2B retailer, we provide salespeople with their own model's price recommendations in real time. We find that, despite the loss of private salesperson information, reducing intertemporal behavioral biases by providing the model's price to the salesperson increases profits for treated quotes by 11% relative to a control condition. Using counterfactual analyses, we show that although the model's pricing leads to higher profitability in most cases, salespeople generate higher profits when pricing out-of-the-ordinary or complex quotes. Accordingly, we propose a machine learning hybrid pricing strategy with two levels of automation. First, a random forest model automatically allocates quotes to either the model or the salesperson based on its prediction of whose pricing would generate higher profits. Then, if the quote is allocated to the model, the model determines the price. The hybrid strategy generates profits significantly higher than either the model or the salespeople.","Karlinsky-Shichor, Y; Netzer, O",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2023.1449,automation; salesforce; pricing; business to business (B2B); field experiment,5.0,,25,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes a hybrid approach to pricing strategies that interprets strategic goals into actionable pricing decisions, fitting well into the tactical decision level.

"The current research demonstrates how conversational robo advisors as opposed to static, non-conversational robo advisors alter perceptions of trust, the evaluation of a financial services firm, and consumer financial decision making. We develop and empirically test a novel conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology, showing that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced onboarding experience), but has important implications for investor behavior, such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors. These findings have important implications for research on trust formation between humans and machines, the effective design of conversational robo advisors, and public policy in the digital economy.","Hildebrand, C; Bergner, A",Operational,10.1007/s11747-020-00753-z,Robo advisors; Chatbots; Consumer financial decision making; Investment automation; Machine intelligence; Trust,5.0,,50,15,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses how conversational robo advisors affect consumer financial decision-making and trust, which relates to managing day-to-day activities of consumers interacting with AI assistants in financial services.",wos-automation,10,20,"Conversational robo advisors as surrogates of trust: onboarding experience, firm perception, and consumer financial decision making",2021
"To increase service productivity, many companies utilize automation extensively to reduce the use of labor. However, greater use of automation does not always result in higher service quality, and the effectiveness of automation in providing service hinges on how advanced the technology level is. Departing from the standard perspective in which productivity is simply treated as an output measure of firm performance, the authors propose service productivity as a strategic decision variable; that is, the firm manages the service productivity level to maximize profits. They develop a theory of optimal service productivity that explains when the optimal productivity level will be higher or lower and distinguishes between short-term effects of service productivity due to labor automation trade-offs and long-term effects due to the advance of technology. The theory, together with the existing literature, inspires the development of three testable empirical hypotheses, which are confirmed using data from more than 700 service companies in two time periods. The research shows that service productivity should be lower when factors (e.g., higher profit margin, higher price) motivate the provision of better service quality and that service productivity should be higher when factors (e.g., higher market concentration, higher wages) discourage the provision of better service quality. The empirical results also provide preliminary evidence that large service companies may tend to be too productive relative to the optimal level and, if so, should place less emphasis (in the short run) on cost reduction through automation and more emphasis on service quality.","Rust, RT; Huang, MH",Strategic,10.1509/jm.10.0441,service productivity; financial impact; marketing metrics; self-service; customer satisfaction; service quality; technology,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the management of service productivity as a strategic decision variable aimed at maximizing profits, indicating long-term planning and goals for service companies.",wos-automation,70,15,Optimizing Service Productivity,2012
"Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers. Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems, and other issues.","Kalaignanam, K; Varadarajan, R",Strategic,10.1007/s11747-011-0291-0,Offshore outsourcing; Cross-border outsourcing; Offshoring; Customer relationship management; Global marketing; International marketing,5.0,,10,5,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of CRM offshore outsourcing, its antecedents, consequences, and broader managerial considerations, indicating a focus on strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-automation,60,20,Offshore outsourcing of customer relationship management: conceptual model and propositions,2012
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify factors influencing firm adoption of internet banking services (IBS). While previous literature has primarily focussed on the individual consumers' adoption, the authors aim to shed light on the adoption of online banking by firms. The authors investigate the propensity and speed of IBS adoption and offer recommendations to providers of IBS and firm users. Design/methodology/approach - To attain the above purpose a conceptual model was based on research about IBS adoption in the firm context that derives primarily from technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovation. The authors use data from 5,002 firms located in 239 counties, encompassing 52.1 percent of firms users of IBS of a financial service provider and 47.9 percent of non-user firms. All sampled firms received an offer to adopt IBS from the financial service provider. Such unique data set was analyzed using logistic regression to assess propensity and a survival analysis model to assess IBS adoption speed. Findings - Results revealed that firms, with high propensity to adopt IBS, operate with a diverse management board, are large and young, and compete with a large number of firm users. The survival model showed that the diverse composition of management board also speeds up IBS adoption. Practical implications - Several implications are drawn from the findings. For instance, managers in firms adopting IBS should invest in recruiting and retaining a diverse set of board members (e. g. internal and external with full decision power), which allows for thorough assessment of pros and cons of any relevant decision to be made. The authors also highlight implications for managers in financial service providers (e. g. bank) that offer IBS to automate the relationship with customer firms. Managers should consider the study as a template for the selection criteria of firms that are likely to accept the IBS offer. Originality/value - This is one of few empirical studies to investigate the adoption of IBS in a firm context. Previous studies focussed on the individual consumer adoption of IBS. The authors show that adopting diverse set of board management, growing in size, young firms and facing the competitive environment positively influence firm's propensity to adopt IBS. The authors also analyze the time spent by firms from the IBS offering to the adoption, which shows that management decision context play a key role in adoption speed. The research contributions add to the scarce ongoing discussion about firm's adoption of IBS.","Claro, DP; Rosa, RB",Strategic,10.1108/MIP-11-2015-0226,B2B relationship; Firm technology adoption; Internet banking service; Relationship automation,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses factors influencing firm adoption of internet banking services, which relates to long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.

"Purpose The purpose of this study is to model the consumer journey of admission-based membership services from initial purchase to full-season memberships. Particularly, the study pays attention to customer-owned contacts (purchase behavior) and service-owned contacts (salesperson voice- and text-based communications), to examine longitudinal internal data to determine factors which hinder and propel customers toward full memberships. Design/methodology/approach On the basis of big data supplied by a National Hockey League team, the study uses three simultaneous equations in modeling to account for potential endogeneity related to the likelihood that sales and service personnel are more likely to contact frequent customers. The longitudinal data allow us to map the customer journey over the course of multiple years, compared to typical cross-section studies. Findings The findings show that as customers increasingly own committed points of contact, they are prepared to move to the next level - but rarely skip major steps in the relationship journey. The quantity, type and timing of customer contacts by the service firm may hinder or propel the customer down the path to purchase full memberships. Research limitations/implications The prevalence of big data among service firms should allow researchers to better understand how consumers respond to contact strategies over time, as well as fluctuations in firm performance. The research adds to the customer journey research stream, while meeting the call of researchers to bridge the gap between service marketing research priorities and current practice. Practical implications Sales practices and marketing automation tactics may come at the cost of burning leads and alienating future members. Frequent text-based contacts absent voice-based interactions hinder consumer journey and work against relationship building. Service marketers can learn how to better allocate resources, properly manage and motivate contact strategies and target campaigns to send the right message via the right media at the right time. Originality/value This is the first study to map customer journey for admission-based, membership services. The longitudinal approach across multiple years provides a deep understanding of how customers take steps toward loyal membership status, while also pinpointing potential drawbacks of current contact strategies.","George, M; Wakefield, KL",Tactical,10.1108/JSM-03-2017-0071,Big data; Customer journey; Admission-based services; Contact strategy; Membership services,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on interpreting strategic goals into actionable insights regarding customer journey and contact strategies for membership services.

"The concept of justification and evaluation of systems, projects, and technologies has traditionally fallen within the scope of internal enterprise decision-making. Yet, with the growth of inter-organizational projects, technologies, and programs, the evaluation process takes on a broader and more complex characteristic. Previously, strategic justification and selection focused on internal departments within an organization and meeting their requirements. Within this context the decision was usually tied to strategic goals and directions of the firm, a common element for all departments. Even though the objectives and directions may have some minor conflicts among these various groups, the decision ultimately came down to one decision maker or group that had the best interests of that specific organization in mind. With inter-organizational systems, such as information systems used in managing the supply chain, the conflicts are between organizations that may have more than one supply chain that they are a part of, with varying strategic directions. The additional complexities of multiorganizational systems evaluation are evaluated within a framework described in this paper. The paper's goal is to introduce the various factors and present a decision framework that will aid members of the supply chain and a supply chain director in deciding which electronic commerce technology media and software is most suitable for the whole supply chain. The techniques used in this approach include both qualitative and quantitative measurements for the evaluation or justification of these systems. The framework uses an integrative set of models based on the analytical hierarchy process and goal programming. An illustrative example provides some managerial insight into the framework and decision environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"An important component of making critical decisions is the ability to accurately predict future performance. This is essential for the sales function of a business, as so many factors hinge on the sales forecast. Accordingly, quantitative data should build projections based on sound data analysis. This study identifies how sales professionals (both sales managers and salespeople) are achieving this, given modern-day tools that are available, as well as the resulting impacts. In addition to some demographics, the study examines the perceptions concerning several forecasting sales force automation components, specifically enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer relationship management (CRM) software. These perceptions have tremendous impacts on the ability to integrate new state-of-the-art predictive analytic tools to help in the allocation of such resources as time, money, and talent. Perceptions indicate a need to better understand how to integrate the power of CRM, ERP, and other technologies to take advantage of the opportunities provided by such tools.

"Purpose - User acceptance is a necessary precondition to implementing self-driving buses as a solution to public transport challenges. Focusing on potential users in a real-life setting, this paper aims to analyze the factors that affect their willingness to use public autonomous shuttles (PASs) as well as their word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Design/methodology/approach - Grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), the study was carried out on a sample of 318 potential users in a real-life setting. The hypothesized relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - The study reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation and trust are significant predictors of PAS usage intention, which is, in turn, related to WOM communication. Additionally, the factors that impact the intention to use a PAS are found to exert an indirect effect on WOM, mediated by usage intention. Practical implications - This study includes practical insights for transport decision-makers on PAS service design, marketing campaigns and WOM monitoring. Originality/value - While extant research focuses on passengers who have tried autonomous shuttles in experimental settings, this article adopts the perspective of potential users who have no previous experience with these vehicles and identifies the link between usage intention and WOM communication in a real-life traffic environment.","Quinones, M; Romero, J; Schmitz, A; Díaz-Martín, AM",Tactical,10.1108/EJMBE-07-2023-0224,Autonomous vehicle; Autonomous shuttle; Driverless shuttle; Self-driving bus; Technology adoption; Technology acceptance; Usage intention; Word-of-mouth; Sustainable mobility; Smart mobility; Robots; UTAUT2,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses factors influencing user acceptance of public autonomous shuttles (PASs) and their word-of-mouth intentions, which are more aligned with structured decision-making processes related to marketing strategies and user engagement.",wos-autonomous,10,70,What factors determine the intention to use and recommend public autonomous shuttles in a real-life setting?,2024
"PurposeMarketing is all about understanding your consumers and giving them what they want. However, this process becomes more complicated in times of economic crisis and national slowdown. Consumers can become scattered and unpredictable in their behaviour, making it hard to understand what they want or need. At times like these, it is more important than ever to rely on qualitative market research to understand the views of consumers and managers. Thus, this study aims to look at the significant consumer challenges that arise during times of crisis and the marketing strategies that managers prefer to counter the crisis. Design/methodology/approachThe data collected for this study involves an extensive literature review followed by personal interviews with industry experts. This study presents two separate models, indicating hierarchical relationships among consumer challenges during crisis and marketing strategies using the total interpretive structural modelling approach. Further MICMAC analysis (popularly known as cross-impact matrix multiplication) was also performed to assess each variable's driving and dependence power. FindingsPrice sensitiveness and adaptive buying result as driving factors with the highest driving and lowest dependence power, which further gives rise to other consumer behaviour challenges. Likewise, the most critical strategies are information systems and the formation of crisis management teams during a crisis. At the same time, other strategies have resulted as linkage and dependent factors and none as the autonomous factor. Originality/valueThis paper provides a systematic understanding of how a manager can understand the challenges consumers face during a crisis and suggests a powerful summary of strategies companies can implement to sail through a crisis.","Ishrat, I; Hasan, M; Farooq, A; Khan, FM",Strategic,10.1108/QMR-12-2021-0149,Marketing strategies; Consumer; Challenges; Crisis; COVID; TISM,5.0,,5,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses understanding consumer challenges during crises and suggests marketing strategies, indicating a focus on long-term organizational goals and frameworks for decision-making in uncertain environments.",wos-autonomous,70,20,Modelling of consumer challenges and marketing strategies during crisis,2023
"Autonomous cars are considered to be the next disruptive innovation that will affect consumers. It can be expected that not only traditional automakers will enter this market (e.g., Ford) but also technology companies (e.g., Google) and newer companies dedicated to self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla). We take a brand extension perspective and analyze to what extent consumers prefer autonomous cars from these brand categories. Our empirical study is based on discrete choice experiments about adopting autonomous vehicles in a purchase scenario and in a renting context. Our findings show that brands play a central role when making autonomous driving decisions. Brand preferences differ systematically when buying versus renting a self-driving car. While technology brands are most preferred overall, consumers favor automaker brands over new brands only when purchasing, not when renting. We further disentangle the brand strength into the marginal effects of image associations. For example, Google's strong brand positioning can be explained by experiences with the parent brand, but it could still improve brand strength by highlighting the relevance of the associated brand portfolio for self-driving cars. The effect of these brand extension success factors differs between parent-brand categories and also between the renting and purchasing scenarios, which requires a dedicated brand management.","Eggers, F; Eggers, F",Strategic,10.1007/s11002-021-09571-x,Autonomous cars; Brand extension; Brand image; Innovations; Conjoint analysis,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of brand preferences in the autonomous car market, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals in understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics.",wos-autonomous,60,25,Drivers of autonomous vehicles-analyzing consumer preferences for self-driving car brand extensions,2022
"In this article, we explore consumers' perceptions of marketing and the extent to which they believe that marketing can play a positive transformative role in society. Findings from 36 semistructured interviews indicate that consumers typically perceive marketing as having a traditional short-term, transactional, and company-focused orientation rather than a transformative one. This was reflected in participants' views of marketing, as well as in their choices and comments when they were given two academic definitions of marketing and one description of unethical marketing and asked to choose the one they thought best described marketing. In addition, participants viewed marketing as manipulative, and most held one-sidedly negative opinions of its transformative potential. The majority did not feel autonomous in their purchase decisions, calling into question marketers' usual defence that consumers are sovereign. In a similar vein, they expressed concerns about the effects of marketing's manipulative and deceptive techniques on vulnerable consumers. These findings are rather worrying given that enhancing the transformative potential of marketing requires a more nuanced understanding of its role and function within society. Accordingly, we argue that successful transformative marketing interventions need to take into account and address consumers' disbelief as to the capacity of marketing to improve social welfare.

"As a mature tourism destination, the Balearic Islands suffer the normal effects of the stagnation stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC) model. During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism. The demand remains at the same levels of seasonality as in the 1990s, suggesting the ineffectiveness of the policies implemented.","Sastre, MAG; Hormaeche, MA; Villar, MT",Strategic,10.5367/te.2015.0519,seasonality; marketing plan; tourism destination; Balearic Islands,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The abstract discusses long-term tourism policies and their effectiveness in addressing seasonal variation in the Balearic Islands, which aligns with strategic planning focused on long-term goals and organizational nature.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Are regional political decisions the key element in reducing seasonal variation in tourism?

"A paradigm shift in marketing seems to be underway. Inspired by Vargo and Lusch's (2004a) proposal of service dominant logic, customer integration is proposed as a key component of marketing. Three stages of service provision are identified: facilities, transformation. and usage. The stages differ in terms of resource origin (company or customer), autonomy of decision-making (integrative or autonomous), and value (potential value, value-in-transformation. and value-in-use). These perspectives, which are synthesized in the study framework, shed light on the process of service provision and direct or indirect knowledge application (Vargo and Lusch 2004a). The author aims to show that in the context of the proposed framework, customer integration is vital to the implementation of service provision.","Moeller, S",Strategic,10.1177/1094670508324677,customer integration; service dominant logic; marketing implementation; service provision,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses a paradigm shift in marketing and emphasizes the importance of customer integration within service provision, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.",wos-autonomous,65,20,Customer Integration-A Key to an Implementation Perspective of Service Provision,2008
"Digitalisation is a tool for the development of tourism destinations and products. This trend has gained relevance in recent years due to new marketing and distribution processes. Consumers are an increasingly demanding and autonomous market that seeks information, speed and online availability throughout the decision-making process and enjoyment of the trip. Beside, businesses and destinations are committed to strategic lines of online marketing with the aim of expanding the target market, automating processes and streamlining and facilitating the purchase. Moreover, Covid-19 has necessarily accelerated this digitalisation process and users are increasingly using online platforms for their trips. Within this commercial process of digitalisation, tourism service providers must focus on security in order to guarantee a good and quality service. Through a case study and a cluster analysis of travel agencies in Extremadura, as a rural destination, an approach to the web security of the main travel agencies, management groups and commercial groups is carried out. The main objective is to evaluate the real capacity of rural destination marketing through online platforms taking into account web security for users. The results show a tendency to centralise web management in management groups or online management entities to ensure privacy in the purchasing process.","Moreno-Lobato, A; Pasaco-Gonzalez, BS; Sánchez-Vargas, E; Hernández-Mogollón, JM",Tactical,10.17561/ree.n2.2023.7765,travel agencies; distribution; digitalisation; tourism marketing; web security,5.0,,15,0,"UNIV JAEN, SERV PUBLICACIONES","The abstract discusses the implementation of digitalisation strategies in tourism marketing, focusing on specific processes such as online marketing, user engagement, and web security, which aligns with structured tactical decisions interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",wos-autonomous,20,60,WEB SECURITY IN ONLINE TOURISM DISTRIBUTION OF RURAL DESTINATIONS: THE CASE OF EXTREMADURA,2023

"This research aims to empirically examine the interrelationships between online impulse buying tendencies (IBT), hedonic motives, online promotions, impulse purchase decision (IPD), and customer satisfaction. A structured survey instrument was used to collect data from 625 consumers from southern India. After checking the psychometric properties of the survey instrument with structural equation modeling, the moderated-mediation model was analyzed using Hayes PROCESS. The results showed that (i) impulse purchase decision (IPD) mediated the relationship between impulsive buying tendency (IBT) and customer satisfaction (CS), (ii) hedonic motives moderated the relationship between IBT and IPD, and (iii) hedonic motives and online promotions moderate the relationship between IPD and CS. This study contributes to the literature because it provides valuable insight into two-way and three-way interactions among the significant variables in consumer behavior.

In transformation to a market economy, the position of the consumer in the market changes successively, too. The importance of an autonomous position of the customer as a decisive actor of the consumers' market requires concentration of the attention to the field of research of the consumer and his behaviour of purchase.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to craft a future research agenda to advance smart service research and practice. Smart services are delivered to or via intelligent objects that feature awareness and connectivity. For service researchers and managers, one of the most fascinating aspects of smart service provision is that the connected object is able to sense its own condition and its surroundings and thus allows for real-time data collection, continuous communication and interactive feedback. Design/methodology/approach - This article is based on discussions in the workshop on Fresh perspectives on technology in service at the International Network of Service Researchers on September 26, 2014 at CTF, Karlstad, Sweden. The paper summarizes the discussion on smart services, adds an extensive literature review, provides examples from business practice and develops a structured approach to new research avenues. Findings - We propose that smart services vary on their individual level of autonomous decision-making, visibility and embeddedness in objects and customer lives. Based on a discussion of these characteristics, we identify research avenues regarding the perception and nature of smart services, the adoption of smart services, the innovation through smart services as well as regarding the development of new business models. Originality/value - Smart services is a new emerging topic in service marketing research, their implications on organizations, customers and the service landscape have not been fully explored. We provide a fresh perspective on service research by characterizing relevant aspects of smart service that will stimulate fruitful future research and advance the understanding and practice of smart services.","Wünderlich, NV; Heinonen, K; Ostrom, AL; Patricio, L; Sousa, R; Voss, C; Lemmink, JGAM",Strategic,10.1108/JSM-01-2015-0040,Connected services; Intelligent object; New service type; Smart services,5.0,,10,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract outlines a future research agenda for smart service research, focusing on long-term implications and the foundational understanding of smart services in a marketing context.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Futurizing smart service: implications for service researchers and managers,2015

"Market segmentation is a key concept in marketing that groups consumers by their needs, characteristics, or purchasing behavior. The objectives of this research are to develop outranking multicriteria models based on preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) in order to segment food consumers and apply them to a survey of healthy and sustainable meat. The models consider two categories of purchasing criteria; one related to product and another to the distributor process. One model generates ordered segments of consumers, while the other obtains four segments according to consumer performance in both criteria categories. An extension of FlowSort method for the sorting problems with Likert scale data is also contributed. The profile of segments shows the significance level of variables such as gender, but mainly those related to food-related lifestyles, when characterizing the consumer groups.

"Objective: The objective of this research is to develop a structural model for measuring cultural tourism behavior, which helps to better understand the profile, motivation, and behavior of Spanish cultural tourists in their trips within Spain and abroad. Methodology: A hypothetic-deductive method has been used where, after reviewing the literature, focusing on the importance of considering the client's experience, a set of hypotheses are presented that materialize in an exploratory model. These hypotheses are later tested through a system of structural equations (SEM), estimated with data contained in the Tourism Survey of Residents / FAMILITUR of the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Results: The model allows confirming a set of indicators that make it possible to analyze the behavior of Spanish cultural tourists in their trips within Spain, in the different Autonomous Communities (Comunidades Autonomas). Limitations: The variables present in the Resident Tourism Survey/FAMILITUR are framed in the general guidelines given by the World Tourism Organization to study the demand, establishing a general framework and not as specific as would be required for a more segmented study of the demand for cultural tourism.

"This paper analyzes, in the context of negotiation, the problem of coordination and conflict resolution between the manufacturer (Seller) and the retailers (Buyers) for a two-tier inventory system. The retailers capture demand (from customers) and therefore are responsible for the level of service offered by the system. The larger the inventory that a retailer has of a particular product, the lower the probability of running out of stock and therefore, avoid the possibility of a lost sale for the manufacturer. A conflict arises (and therefore the negotiation process starts) when the manufacturer wants the retailer to increase the level of service while retailers are satisfied with the status quo. Using the Nash bargaining solution, we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates behavioral dimensions and predicts the outcome of sharing the profit. The results indicate the advantage of developing long term relationships among the members of the distribution channel to minimize the uncertainty and therefore the source of conflict.","Ernst, R; López-Sánchez, JI; Urbano, D",Strategic,10.1007/s10726-008-9139-5,Negotiation; Marketing; Game theory; Operations; Collaborative seller-buyers,5.0,,5,0,SPRINGER,"The paper discusses long-term relationships and coordination in a two-tier inventory system, focusing on conflict resolution and negotiation strategies between manufacturers and retailers.

"Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way. This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM) concept, which reflects consumers' perception of a country's commitment to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to ecological (in)congruence-when the sustainability reputation of a COM is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels-vary across product categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions, whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.","Tran, TTH; Paparoidamis, NG",Strategic,10.1177/1069031X20920869,adoption intentions; country of manufacture; eco-innovations; product eco-friendliness,5.0,,10,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of consumer perceptions of eco-innovations based on the ecological country-of-manufacture concept, indicating a broad understanding of market dynamics and consumer behavior that aligns with strategic planning.",wos-autonomous,60,20,Eco-Innovations in Global Markets: The Effect of Ecological (In)Congruence on Consumers' Adoption Intentions,2020
"Purpose - Although the wireless internet attracts more and more interest from marketers and researchers, there is little empirical evidence of multinational corporations' (MNCs) adoption of pull-type mobile advertising in global markets. The aim of this study is to fill this research gap, by conducting an empirical survey of the perceptions of MNCs operating in Europe regarding SMS-based mobile advertising adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The study proposes six basic constructs which are thought to influence MNCs' decision-making process on mobile advertising adoption. On this base, a structured questionnaire is developed. The data are obtained by telephone interviews from 53 senior executives of MNCs' subsidiaries in Spain. Findings - Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that branding strategy, facilitating conditions, and security and costs are the strongest determinants of MNCs' mobile advertising adoption. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicates that Japanese, American, and European firms are statistically classifiable according to their cultural affiliation in terms of their perceptions of mobile advertising adoption. Japanese firms are the least willing to use mobile advertising, while their American counterparts are the most motivated in this regard. Originality/value - While SMS-based mobile marketing has been receiving an increasing attention from both academics and practitioners, there exists little empirical research on this area. In this vein, this study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, the study proposes a conceptual research model based on six basic constructs, which incorporate both theoretical and practical perspectives. Second, the model is tested by empirical data obtained from top managers of MNCs' subsidiaries operating in a European market.

In order to differentiate themselves from competition, marketers have adopted e-business to provide superior service that satisfies consumers and ultimately create consumers' perceived value. The benefits of e-shopping also come with potential risks that the consumers must be aware of. One of the biggest challenges of e-stores is attracting enough online customers to be profitable and survive. That is why a shift in buying behaviour and attitude of consumers toward e-shopping is a key to success of e-stores. The present study focuses on identifying the key factors influencing consumers' perceived benefits and risks while shopping online.

"This research challenges the notion that autonomy is beneficial for consumers in every situation. Specifically, this research demonstrates across two experiments and one field study that autonomy can lead to pleasure only when risk is low. Importantly, these studies also identify personal control as a mechanism that explains why autonomy makes the consumption experience more or less pleasurable, depending on risk perceptions. In Study 1, we demonstrate that perceived risk moderates the effect that autonomy may have on making the experience pleasurable, with a lack of risk making autonomy increase personal control. Study 2 replicates this moderating effect of risk in a field study. To test if the effects replicate using another type of perceived risk, Study 3 manipulates social risk and replicates its moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy and personal control on the pleasure observed in Studies 1 and 2.

An online between-subjects factorial experimental design with 559 subjects from a consumer panel was performed to test the proposed model. The empirical evidence suggests that congruency should be considered a key moderating variable when assessing the impact of content and messages on social media since it might significantly change how content affects online users' decision-making process. If hotel management is thus unable to properly manage its responses to users' comments in a congruent way, posts related to the ambience dimension become more important. Furthermore, congruence between a published post and the subsequent management response to user comments effectively leads to higher engagement, functional brand image, hedonic brand image and booking intention than incongruent or no management response.","Veloso, M; Ieva, M; Gómez-Suárez, M",Tactical,10.1080/19368623.2023.2241041,Management response; content type; social media; hotel; congruence; hotel experience,5.0,,15,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The study focuses on user engagement, booking intention, and hotel brand image in response to social media posts and management responses, which aligns closely with tactical marketing decisions aimed at improving specific outcomes.",wos-autonomous,10,70,"Social media content strategy in hospitality: the impact of experiential posts and response congruence on engagement, hotel image, and booking intention",2024

"PurposeThis research aimed to analyze and prioritize the factors affecting sustainable marketing (SM) and sustainable operation (SO) of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs through big data adoption (BDA).Design/methodology/approachThe technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical base and data were gathered from manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia. The 159 questionnaire replies of chief executive officer (CEO)/managers were analyzed using a hybrid approach of structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN).FindingsThe findings of this study showed that perceived benefits (PB), technological complexity (TC), organization's resources (OR), organization's management support (OMS) and government legislation (GL) are the factors that influence BDA and promote SM and SO. The findings of ANN showed that a perceived benefit is the most important factor, followed by OMS.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can assist SMEs managers in making strategic decisions and improving sustainable performance and thus contribute to overall economic development.Originality/valueThe manufacturing industry is under immense pressure to integrate sustainable practices for long-term success. BDA can assist industries in aligning industries' operational capabilities. The majority of the current research have mainly emphasized on BDA in corporations. However, the associations between BDA and sustainable performance of manufacturing SMEs have been less explored. To address this issue, this study developed a theoretical model and examined the influence of BDA on SM and SO of manufacturing SMEs. Meanwhile, the hybrid methodological approach can help to uncover both linear and non-linear relationships better.","Baig, MI; Yadegaridehkordi, E; Nasir, MHNB",Strategic,10.1108/MD-06-2022-0778,Big data adoption; Sustainable marketing; Sustainable operations; SMEs,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The research focuses on analyzing factors affecting sustainable marketing and operations of SMEs through big data adoption, which aligns with long-term organizational goals and strategic decision-making.",wos-big data,60,25,Influence of big data adoption on sustainable marketing and operation of SMEs: a hybrid approach of SEM-ANN,2023

"According to the literature, companies that use consumer data from digital marketing can have better results than those that do not. However, investments in analytics have gradually declined and most research does not place the use of data in strategic processes. Thus, this paper proposes a model to evaluate the incorporation of external knowledge generated by data, with the organization's internal knowledge, through the insertion of the absorptive capacity as a mediator between the use of digital marketing data and the effectiveness of marketing decision-making. To this end, a survey of 144 Brazilian retail companies was conducted and it was found that there is mediation, but it is partial. The findings suggest some insights into actions that can be taken to improve the use of data by the organization, such as the importance of disseminating marketing data, so that it can be used strategically by decision-makers.","Proença, M; Martins, TS",Strategic,10.1057/s41270-023-00224-8,Absorptive capacity; Marketing decision-making effectiveness; Digital marketing analytics; Marketing; Retail,5.0,,10,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,"The abstract discusses the incorporation of external knowledge through data, the role of absorptive capacity as a mediator, and how these factors influence the effectiveness of marketing decision-making, which aligns with long-term organizational goals.",wos-big data,60,25,The role of absorptive capacity in the use of digital marketing analytics for effective marketing decisions,2023
"The development of information technology (IT) causes an increase in the amount of data to be created, stored and processed for the needs of various organizations. Segmentation is one of the marketing tools can help the organization to promote sales activities and benefit from it. It is important for marketing practitioners and decision makers to understand the concept of predictive modelling and have an understanding of how to use big data for segmentation purposes. Marketing and Information Technology are blending due to digitalization, statistics is becoming more important due to the rise of big data and data mining opportunities. Boarders of different disciplines are becoming vaguer and interconnection of disciplines can be observed more often. The purpose of the study is to create customer segments based on predictive modelling by using big data available in an organization. Data for modelling is used from a non-banking lending company based in Latvia AS 4finance. The process of data mining is described and performed in the study using data provided by the company. For the data mining process and the development of customer segments, the authors selected RapidMiner Studio software and used CRISP-DM data mining methodology. Three types of activities were tested to evaluate the economic benefit of created segmentation model on overall 11321 customers. All customers were segmented into two groups based on the created predictive model - one group contained customers that were predicted to become an inactive and second group with customers that were not predicted to become inactive. All customers were split into three groups containing a similar split of predicted outcome. Three different types of activities were performed with all three groups. As a result, common characteristics of segmentation and predictive modelling were identified. The results of the empirical study show that it is possible to create customer segments by using sophisticated predictive model. This can be achieved without having to write statistical software codes. The study results also show that the organization can benefit from the implementation of segmentation based on data mining and predictive modelling in key business areas. Segmentation model created during research show economic benefit for the company. Authors also indicate that this segmentation approach can be replicated in different business areas.","Verdenhofs, A; Tambovceva, T",Tactical,10.21272/mmi.2019.1-20,segmentation; Big Data; predictive modelling; decision tree; RapidMiner,5.0,,15,0,"SUMY STATE UNIV, DEPT MARKETING & MIA","The abstract discusses the creation of customer segments using predictive modeling and big data, focusing on specific marketing activities to evaluate the economic benefit of segmentation.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate how big data collected from social media contribute to knowledge management practices, innovation processes and business performance. Design/methodology/approach The study used 418 questionnaires collected from firms that actively invest in marketing, advertising and communication in the Italian market. The hypotheses testing and analysis were conducted using structural equation modeling. Findings The results reveal that customers' data gathered from social media produce different effects on knowledge management practices and firms' innovation capacity. Furthermore, increased innovation capacity turned out to affect customer relationship performance directly, while it contributes to gain better financial performance only when it is used to gain relational outcomes. Originality/value The outcomes of the study help firms to develop a clear understanding about which big data retrieved from social media can be useful to improve their knowledge management practices and enhance their innovation capacity.

"Despite advances in big data analytics (BDA), its traditional adoption utility discourse is yet to move beyond early capture to focus on its postadoption impacts on firms' financial performance (FP) and nonfinancial performance (NFP), especially in developing economies like Nigeria's. This study advances the BDA field, whose existing utilitarian discourse on organizational readiness for change does not generally reflect the empirical and analytical reality of 261 Nigerian professionals. By drawing on business-to-business marketing, dynamic capabilities, and technology-organization-environment theoretical frameworks, we first contribute a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) to develop nine testable hypotheses to initially highlight which factors really impact on organizations' readiness to adopt BDA, second, to show the real impacts of management's post-BDA-adoption, which existing scholarship on BDA discourse had missed. Consequently, our study's findings were used to develop Fig. 2, showing the direct and moderating nature of interactions between BDA and TOE variables, from which hypotheses one and two demonstrate support for the technological and value creation of BDA adoption. However, whereas hypotheses three and four confirm top management's support and overall organizational readiness for BDA adoption in line with existing literature, paradoxically, this study's hypotheses five and seven contribute to the existing BDA discourse by highlighting that environmental, competitive pressure (CP), including regulation does not support the adoption of BDA. Additionally, while external support (H6) was found conducive for BDA adoption in line with current literature. Interestingly, hypotheses eight, nine, and 10a were also found supportive of not only FP but also NFP. However, contrary to current theorization, hypothesis 10b was not found supportive of NFP. Therefore, contrary to previous TOE scholarship, our results contribute to the BDA discourse additionally showing how CP and regulatory environment are not significantly supportive of BDA adoption; second, by highlighting how TOE's critical regulation and competition factors for BDA adoption are additionally nonimpactful on management's decision to adopt BDA. Finally, additional moderating factors particularly on external competition and government regulatory compliance are critical in ascertaining not only organizations' FP but also their NFP readiness in the Nigerian context. The implications and limitations are discussed.","Egwuonwu, A; Mendy, J; Smart-Oruh, E; Egwuonwu, A",Strategic,10.1109/TEM.2023.3321426,Big data (BD) adoption; dynamic capabilities (DCs); management; manufacturing and service industries; Nigeria; technology-organization-environment,5.0,,10,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses the impacts of big data analytics (BDA) adoption on organizations' financial and non-financial performance in a developing economy, focusing on long-term organizational readiness and changes in strategic capabilities, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-big data,60,20,Drivers of Big Data Analytics’ Adoption and Implications of Management Decision-Making on Big Data Adoption and Firms’ Financial and Nonfinancial Performance: Evidence From Nigeria's Manufacturing and Service Industries,2023
"In 2012, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, representing the single largest source of revenue for banks fromdemand deposit accounts during this period. Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because of impulsive spending. However, we also find that highmonitoring costs hinder consumers' effort to track their balance accurately; consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention. The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft waiver programs may also enhance social welfare. This paper explains consumer responses to overdraft fees and evaluates alternative pricing strategies associated with these fees.","Liu, X; Montgomery, A; Srinivasan, K",Strategic,10.1287/mksc.2018.1106,banking; overdraft fees; dynamic programming; big data,2.0,,10,3,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses the evaluation of consumer responses to overdraft fees and alternative pricing strategies, indicating a long-term impact on bank revenue and consumer welfare, which aligns with strategic planning.",wos-big data,60,25,Analyzing Bank Overdraft Fees with Big Data,2018
"Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others.

"PurposeDigital technologies, digitalised consumers and the torrent of customer data have been transforming marketing practice. In discussing such trends, existing research has either focussed on the skills marketers need or broad-based approaches such as agile methods but has given less consideration to just how such skills or approaches might be developed and used in marketers' day-to-day activities and in the organisation of marketing in the firm. This is what the authors address in this paper.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopts an in-depth case study approach to examine an exemplary digital enterprise in transformation of their digital marketing. The insights were gathered from 25 interviews, netnography and document analysis of the case organisation in addition to 10 interviews with independent experts.FindingsDrawing on practice-oriented approach, the authors show how organisations respond to the emerging trends of digital consumers and big data by taking a 'hacking marketing' approach and developing novel marketing expertise at disciplinary boundaries. The authors put forward three sets of practices that enable and shape the hacking marketing approach. These include spanning the expertise boundary, making value measurable and experimenting through which their adaptive, iterative and multidisciplinary work occurs. This explains how managing digital consumers and big data is not within the realm of information technology (IT) functions but marketing and how marketing professionals are changing their practice and moving their disciplinary boundaries.Practical implicationsThis study offers practical contributions for firms in terms of identifying new work practices and expertise that marketing specialists need in managing digital platforms, digitalised consumers and big data. This study's results show that enterprises need to design and implement strong training programmes to prepare their marketing workforce in adopting experimentations of agile approach and data-driven decision making. In addition, Marketing education should be changed so that programmes consider a review of their courses and include the novel marketing models and approaches into their curriculum.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the nascent discussions by unpacking how enterprises can develop new marketing expertise and practices beyond skillsets and how such practices form new hacking marketing approach which addresses the problem of the inability of the conventional marketing approach to show its value within the firm.","Hafezieh, N; Pollock, N; Ryan, A",Strategic,10.1108/JEIM-12-2021-0530,Digitalised consumers; Practice; Expertise; Digital marketing; Digital organisation; Occupations; Hacking,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The abstract discusses the transformation of marketing practices in response to digital technologies and big data, emphasizing long-term organizational development of new marketing expertise and practices.

"In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the outside-in perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders.

A covariance-based structural equation modelling approach was used to assess the measurement and structural models in this research due to its ability to offer a strong foundation for analyzing intricate linkages within a research framework. The outcome confirmed the significant and positive relationships between BDAC, BT, and IP. Concurrently, these relationships were partially influenced by DAISC. The practitioners would greatly benefit from detailed insights on the findings, as they would provide guidance on how to identify and take advantage of the growth opportunities afforded by digital technology. Moreover, the observations could provide policymakers with new insights on necessary policy measures to support the application of digital technologies and encourage the implementation of a dynamic accounting information system, which could result in significant benefits in the future.","Pham, HQ; Vu, PK",Strategic,10.2478/mmcks-2024-0007,dynamic accounting information system; big data analytics; internationalization; Small and Medium Enterprises,5.0,,10,5,SCIENDO,"The study focuses on long-term implications of Big Data Analytics Capabilities and Blockchain Technology on the Internationalization Process of SMEs, which aligns with strategic planning and decision-making.",wos-big data,60,20,Managing big data and blockchain for enterprise internationalization process: Mediating role of dynamic accounting system capability,2024
"PurposeThis study aims to investigate organizational learning, represented by the absorptive capacity, as a condition for the firm to learn about marketing data and make more informed decisions. The authors also aimed to understand how the behavior of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) businesses differ in this scenario through a multilevel perspective.Design/methodology/approachPlacing absorptive capacity as a mediator of the relationship between business analytics and rational marketing decisions, the authors analyzed data from 224 Brazilian retail companies using structural equation modeling estimated with partial least squares. To test the cross-level moderation effect, the authors also performed a multilevel analysis in RStudio.FindingsThe authors found a partial mediation of the absorptive capacity in the relation between business analytics and rational marketing decisions. The authors also discovered that, in the MSMEs firms' group, even if smaller companies find it more difficult to use data, those that do may reap more benefits than larger ones. This is due to the influence of size in how firms handle information.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample size, despite having shown to be consistent and valid, is considered small for a multilevel study. This suggests that our multilevel results should be viewed as suggestive, rather than conclusive, and subjected to further validation.Practical implicationsRather than solely positioning business analytics as a tool for decision support, the authors' analysis highlights the importance for firms to develop the absorptive capacity to enable ongoing acquisition, exploration and management of knowledge.Social implicationsMSMEs are of economic and social importance to most countries, especially developing ones. This research aimed to improve understanding of how this group of firms could transform knowledge into better decisions. The authors also highlight micro and small firms' difficulties with the use of marketing data so that they can have more effective practices.Originality/valueThe research contributes to the understanding of organizational mechanisms to absorb and learn from the vast amount of current marketing information. Recognizing the relevance of MSMEs, a preliminary multilevel analysis was also conducted to comprehend differences within this group.","Proença, M; Costa, BC; Didonet, SR; Toaldo, AMM; Martins, TS; Frega, JR",Strategic,10.1108/MRR-05-2023-0350,Absorptive capacity; Business analytics; Rational marketing decisions; Micro; small and medium-sized companies; Organizational learning; Marketing strategy,5.0,,10,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study emphasizes the importance of absorptive capacity as a strategic facilitator for firms to better utilize marketing data and make informed decisions, indicating a long-term approach to organizational learning and decision-making.",wos-big data,60,25,How the absorptive capacity could transform data into better decisions: a multilevel perspective to deal with the difference between firm sizes,2024

"Purpose Based on an organizational capability perspective, this paper aims to propose a development model for social media analytics (SMA) capability that can be applied to business-to-business (B2B) marketing, with the aim of facilitating the use and integration of SMA in B2B marketing and maximizing the benefits of business networks in the age of social media. Design/methodology/approach This is a critical interpretive synthesis of SMA publications collected from academic journals, business magazines and the SMA service industry. In addition, an inter-disciplinary approach was adopted by drawing upon both marketing and information systems literature. In total, 123 academic papers, 106 industry case studies and 141 magazine papers were identified and analyzed. The findings were synthesized and compiled to address the predefined research question. Findings An SMA capability development model is proposed. The proposed model consists of four inter-dependent levels (technological, operational, managed and strategic) that collectively transfer the technological capability of SMA to the dynamic organizational capability. Each level of SMA capability is detailed. SMA-in-B2B marketing is highlighted as a socio-technical phenomenon, in which a technological level SMA capability is emphasized as the foundation for developing organizational level SMA capabilities and organizational capabilities, in turn, supporting and managing SMA activities and practices (e.g. strategic planning, social and cultural changes, skills and resources, measurements and values).

"In the wake of globalization, rapid advancements took place in every field. Data science and big data emerged as utmost prominent realms and in this nexus, marketing analytics outgrew as a robust discipline. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how data is used as a competitive weapon, in the age of digital globalization, by marketers and if there is any direct relationship between marketing analytics (its measurement, IT infrastructure and barriers to deploy marketing analytics) and sales performance, and then keeping absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy as mediating variables, it is tested that whether they influence such direct relationship. This is a quantitative research; the questionnaire was being administered to 300 respondents (managers with some marketing managers, directors and chief executives). It avails Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) based multivariate analysis. The result records that there is a positively significant impact of measurement of marketing analytics and IT infrastructure on sales performance and in presence of the mediating variables, absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy, the impact of marketing analytics relatively increases on sales performance. However, barriers to deploy marketing analytics appeared insignificant. This research furnishes insights to marketers and e-marketers to improve sales performance and profitability; for properly applying marketing analytics, practitioners need to have proper IT infrastructure with absorptive capacity and top management team advocacy or support.

"Shifting towards a more data-driven culture is a key antecedent of business success in today's digital era. Previous research has paid attention to exploring the influence of marketing analytics on business performance, and rarely examined how the use of marketing analytics influences customer agility and satisfaction. According to the dynamic capabilities view and using previous studies, we developed a conceptual framework to explore the effect of marketing analytics use on customer agility and customer satisfaction. In Study 1, we utilised cross-sectional data collected from 468 managers from various industries. In study 2, we employed longitudinal data in a threewave longitudinal utilising a cross-lagged panel model. Study 1 indicated that data acquisition and tool acquisition are key drivers in adopting marketing analytics. Marketing analytics use has stronger effect on customer agility when market turbulence is high. They also revealed that the influence of customer agility on customer satisfaction in such conditions is stronger. Study 2 revealed that marketing analytics use at time point T1 has a significant and positive influence on customer agility at time point T2, while customer agility at time point T2 has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction at time point T3. These findings indicate strong temporal effects between marketing analytics use, customer agility, and customer satisfaction.

"Strategic management has extensively contributed to the development of business model research. Although marketing concepts (e.g., customers, value creation, delivery, and exchange) form an essential part of any business model description, from an academic standpoint, the strategy literature has been slow to incorporate contributions from the marketing literature on business model research. Drawing on mixed bibliometric techniques combining co-citation analysis (CCA) and bibliographic coupling analysis (BCA), we seek to fill this gap by exploring the origins and trends of business model research in marketing journals (285 articles published in 38 marketing journals). The CCA reveals three theoretical pillars labelled 'business model rationale in marketing', 'business model conceptual origins', and 'business model literature de-velopments' that provide a consistent base for cross-fertilization. The BCA uncovers eight con-versations organized into two research streams, namely 'holistic perspective' and 'downstream perspective'.

"This study empirically investigates two effects of alternative data availability: stock price informativeness and its disciplining effect on managers' actions. Recent computing advancements have enabled technology companies to collect real-time, granular indicators of fundamentals to sell to investment professionals. These data include consumer transactions and satellite images. The introduction of these data increases price informativeness through decreased information acquisition costs, particularly in firms in which sophisticated investors have higher incentives to uncover information. I document two effects on managers. First, managers reduce their opportunistic trading. Second, investment efficiency increases, consistent with price informativeness improving managers' incentives to invest and divest efficiently.

"This paper analyzes an emerging rebate mode where a cashback website not only serves as a promotional device in generating more sales for an online retailer, but also makes decisions on its marketing effort autonomously under certain product availability conditions set by the online retailer. Using a game-theoretic approach, this paper analyzes the optimal decision of both parties in commission-driven rebate mode and marketing-based rebate mode in a market dominated by the online retailer and cashback website respectively. Our main findings are as follows: (1) In the Retailer Stackelberg (RS) game, which rebate mode an online retailer will adopt is related to the marketing cost of the rebate channel and the consumer utility discount (UD) factor. (2) Both rebate modes will help the retailer to expand the market and increase profit because of price differentiation. (3) There is a possible price trap in marketing-based rebate mode. (4) In RS game, the effect of consumer UD factor on the optimal marketing effort is related to the product availability in the rebate channel. (5) In both RS game and Cashback-website Stackelberg (CS) game, the online retailer should strive to become a leader.

"Purpose Decision-makers must be well-informed to successfully impact the future of the business. The purpose of this study was to explore experiences of US fashion retail executives when making business decisions to understand what resources and strategies are utilized within the decision-making process. Additionally, the role of academic research within executive decision-making process was explored. Design/methodology/approach This study utilized a phenomenological approach to understand the experiences of fashion retail executives when engaging in business decision-making. Fifteen US fashion retail executives participated in the study. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews and thematically coded to gain a holistic perspective of the decision-making process within the fashion retail industry. Findings As the result of the data analysis and interpretation, three topical areas emerged:: Incredible Amounts of Information, Industry Specific Academic Research and Have a Clear Road Map. The findings suggested that while the facts gleaned from internal and external data are of great importance to fashion professionals, insights gathered from social media are equally influential within the decision-making process. The authors identified five major strategies utilized consistently by fashion retail executives regardless of the type of business they represented: collaboration, adaptability, speed, gut instinct and creativity.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a reference model that will allow us to understand the factors that influence the omnichannel management of an organization in a business-to-business (B2B) context. Design/methodology/approach In building the model, a partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was followed. More than 1,000 executives with a C-level profile (chief executive officer, chief marketing officer or chief digital officer), from manufacturers and wholesalers, in various industries worldwide were contacted. The final sample consisted of 124 C-level executives in multinational B2B companies from 35 countries worldwide. Findings The principal finding is that optimal omnichannel management must involve a customer-centric proposition forming the basis for individualized marketing that tailors the company's portfolio of solutions to suit each client. To ensure this, customer knowledge at each touchpoint is essential. The results show that the main predictor of B2B omnichannel management is sales and marketing, even above channels. The principal conclusions are that the model shows that good omnichannel performance is measured by the performance of the industrial buyer.

"Our increasing capacity to collect, store, and analyze large volumes of data has changed the way in which organizational decision makers approach their work. The ability to accurately quantify variables that previously had been assigned to the gut instinct of grizzled veterans or subject to the wisdom of sages for interpretation can now be more objectively understood. The implications for organizational performance are clear: better data and better decisions yield better performance. In many functions, like marketing, this capability has resulted in a true revolution in how companies come to understand and most profitably serve customers. Other areas, such as talent management, have lagged behind in this regard. This is largely due to the fact that many of the relevant variables (e.g., personality) are difficult to measure. It is also because the relationship between these variables and organizational performance is not entirely understood. Recent developments regarding how we understand and then link individual characteristics and performance are enabling a data revolution in the area of talent management. Herein, we offer three examples that illustrate how data can now be used to improve talent management decisions and, ultimately, organizational performance.

Also, grounded in the lens of luxury fever, we explored how the determinants are differently weighed and processed across two types of STHs, including regular (R-STHs) vs. premium seat holders (P-STHs). Through a partnership with a Big Ten athletic department, the attendance data were obtained and analyzed. This study adapted a decision tree modeling approach to predict renewal/churning behavior by setting learning decision rules in the CHAID algorithm, a supervised learning algorithm family. Results of this study indicate that discounted tickets, affordability, and entertainment were important determinants for R-STHs.

"Using big data to analyze consumer behavior can provide effective decision-making tools for preventing customer attrition (churn) in customer relationship management (CRM). Focusing on a CRM dataset with several different categories of factors that impact customer heterogeneity (i.e., usage of self-care service channels, service duration, and responsiveness to marketing actions), this research provides new predictive analytics of customer churn rate based on a machine learning method that enhances the classification of logistic regression by adding a mixed penalty term. The proposed penalized logistic regression prevents overfitting when dealing with big data and minimizes the loss function when balancing the cost from the median (absolute value) and mean (squared value) regularization. We show the analytical properties of the proposed method and its computational advantage in this research. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed method with a CRM dataset (that has a large number of features) under different settings by efficiently eliminating the disturbance of (1) least important features and (2) sensitivity from the minority (churn) class. Our empirical results confirm the expected performance of the proposed method in full compliance with the common classification criteria (i.e., accuracy, precision, and recall) for evaluating machine learning methods.","Simovic, PP; Chen, CYT; Sun, EW",Tactical,10.1007/s10614-022-10275-1,Big data; Business analytics; CRM; Machine learning; Penalized logistic regression,5.0,,15,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the use of predictive analytics and machine learning to analyze customer behavior in order to prevent customer attrition, which aligns well with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to examine how small- and medium-sized hospitality organisations engage with social media and how social media data are used by their managers to inform business decisions. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was used in this research in which interviews were conducted with top management, comprising the owners/directors and other key managers from small- and medium-sized organisations based in Penang, Malaysia. Fan and Gordon's (2014) categorisation of the social media data analysis process and Simon's (1995) concept of the interactive and diagnostic usage of data were used in the analysis of data. Findings The managers of small- and medium-sized hospitality organisations engage with social media for customer relationship management and the understanding of key main competitors. Social media is used to understand, build and manage relationships with current and potential customers; these activities are also linked to actions taken to protect a company's reputation. Even though, for the companies concerned, data gathering is still at the capture stage with no formal procedures and processes in place, the data are utilised in an interactive way to inform two areas' major business decisions-making, i.e. those related to pricing and promotion and the strategic formulation and reorientation of the business. Research limitations/implications The respondents of this study were mainly from smaller hospitality organisations. Hence, the insights gained are limited to the context of smaller hotels.

The theoretical framework for designing software called Hypertension Management System (HMS) is proposed using underlying principles of game theory by considering patients and doctors as players. The system is installed in the smartphones of players and its functioning follows the hierarchy of Big Data mining and extraction. The theoretical framework of HMS starts from data sensing through physical sensors, proceeds along layers for data processing and reduction, and finally arrives at the decision-making step to assist doctors in the treatment of disease. This novel system will reduce the mortality due to chronic diseases like hypertension by enabling game patients and doctors to deal with its symptoms in a timely manner according to feedback from previous data.","Clim, A; Zota, RD",Out of scope,10.2478/mmcks-2019-0015,Big Data; Bluehost cloud; Game Theory; Nash Equilibrium; Decision support interface; XML; Hypertension Management System (HMS),0.0,,0,100,SCIENDO,"The abstract discusses a healthcare application focused on hypertension management using a game theory model, which does not relate to marketing.",wos-big data,0,0,Game theory in designing mHealth apps for monitoring hypertension,2019
"We introduce a method for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing submarkets in product categories. We give an overview of the market structure and competitive submarket literature and then describe a classic model for testing competitive submarkets along with associated extensions. In the era of big data and with the increasing availability of large-scale consumer purchase data, there is a need for techniques that can interpret these data and use them to help make managerial decisions. We introduce a statistical likelihood based technique for both identifying and testing market structure. We run a series of experiments on generated data and show that our method is better at identifying market structure from brand substitution data than a range of methods described in the marketing literature. We introduce tools for holdout validation, complexity control, and testing managerial hypotheses. We describe a method for visualization of submarket solutions, and we give several traditional consumer product examples and in addition give an example to show how market structure can be analyzed from online review data.","France, SL; Ghose, S",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2015.0958,market structure; likelihood estimation; brand switching; submarket analysis; market segmentation; cluster analysis; big data; visualization,5.0,,15,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a method for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing submarkets in product categories, which involves structured decision-making and data analysis that aligns with tactical marketing analytics and consumer behavior insights.",wos-big data,10,70,An Analysis and Visualization Methodology for Identifying and Testing Market Structure,2016
"Retailers are interested in understanding which price promotions are profitable and which are not. However, simultaneously estimating the promotion effects of a large number of products on retailer sales and profits is technically challenging for both researchers and practitioners. To address this challenge, this study proposes a Partially Profiled Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Partially Profiled LASSO) model, which can estimate ultra-high-dimensional regression relationships at a low computational cost and control for the endogeneity of promotion depth. The model can flexibly incorporate the time-varying promotion effects and the cross-over effects among the promotions of different products. We conduct an empirical study using data provided by a large retailer over a 5-month period. Our model efficiently identifies products with promotion effects and the promotion effects are significantly associated with certain promotion, product, and category characteristics. The results also show that our model with cross-over effects outperforms the benchmark models that are widely used to handle the high-dimensional predictor matrix (e.g., the standard LASSO and principal component regression methods). This article contributes to the related literature on price promotion and marketing analytics in data-rich environments, and provides implications for retailers to make more informed promotion strategies.","Sun, LP; Zheng, XN; Jin, Y; Jiang, MH; Wang, HS",Tactical,10.1111/deci.12354,Endogeneity; Partially Profiled LASSO; Profits; Promotion; Retailer Sales,5.0,,15,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses a model for estimating promotion effects on retailer sales and profits, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, particularly in the context of sales promotion and marketing analytics.",wos-big data,10,70,Estimating Promotion Effects Using Big Data: A Partially Profiled LASSO Model with Endogeneity Correction*,2019
"Purpose This study aims to explore the plausibility of the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) methodology for neuromarketing applications and develop a neurophysiologically-informed model of purchasing behavior based on fNIRS measurements. Design/methodology/approach The oxygenation signals extracted from the purchase trials of each subject were temporally averaged to obtain average signals for buy and pass decisions. The obtained data were analyzed via both linear mixed models for each of the 16 optodes to explore their separate role in the purchasing decision process and a discriminant analysis to construct a classifier for buy/pass decisions based on oxygenation measures from multiple optodes. Findings Positive purchasing decisions significantly increase the neural activity through fronto-polar regions, which are closely related to OFC and vmPFC that modulate the computation of subjective values. The results showed that neural activations can be used to decode the buy or pass decisions with 85 per cent accuracy provided that sensitivity to the budget constraint is provided as an additional factor. Research limitations/implications The study shows that the fNIRS measures can provide useful biomarkers for improving the classification accuracy of purchasing tendencies and might be used as a main or complementary method together with traditional research methods in marketing. Future studies might focus on real-time purchasing processes in a more ecologically valid setting such as shopping in supermarkets. Originality/value This paper uses an emerging neuroimaging method in consumer neuroscience, namely, fNIRS. The decoding accuracy of the model is 85 per cent which presents an improvement over the accuracy levels reported in previous studies. The research also contributes to existing knowledge by providing insights in understanding individual differences and heterogeneity in consumer behavior through neural activities.","Çakir, MP; Çakar, T; Girisken, Y; Yurdakul, D",Tactical,10.1108/EJM-12-2016-0864,Decision-making; Neuromarketing; Purchasing behavior; Purchasing decision; fNIRS; Optical brain imaging,5.0,,15,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"The study focuses on understanding purchasing behavior through fNIRS measurements, which can be applied in marketing strategies like campaign optimization and consumer targeting.

"The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: the number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as selecting which products to advertise or promote.","Li, JQ; Rusmevichientong, P; Simester, D; Tsitsiklis, JN; Zoumpoulis, SI",Strategic,10.1287/mnsc.2014.2066,field experiments; promotions; big data; sparsity,5.0,,5,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses optimizing marketing decisions, specifically pricing strategies, through field experiments and explores the long-term implications of these methods on marketing strategies, which aligns closely with strategic planning.",wos-big data,70,20,The Value of Field Experiments,2015
"The challenge in today's corporations is that even though the technology portfolio of a company plays a crucial role in delivering revenue-falling as a topic mainly under the area of technology management-technology may have a negative image due to observed risks or failing the sustainability criteria. It may influence the company's image and brand image, possibly also influencing decisions at corporate level. The monitoring of technology sentiments is therefore emphasized, benefiting from the advanced methods for business environment scanning, namely market and competitor intelligence functions. This paper utilizes a new big data based method, mostly utilized in market(MI)/competitor intelligence(CI) functions of the company, opinion mining, to analyse the global media sentiment of nuclear power and projects deploying the technology. With this approach, it is easier to understand the linkage to corporate images of companies deploying the technology and also related corporate decisions, mainly done in the areas of technology market deployment, marketing and strategic planning. The results indicate how the media sentiment towards nuclear power has been mostly negative globally, particularly in social media. In addition, results from similar analyses from a single company's images for the companies currently deploying the technology are seemingly less negative, indicating the influence of company's communication and branding activities. This paper has implications showing that a technology's media sentiment can influence a company's brand image, marketing communications and the need for actions when technology is deployed. In conclusion, there seems to be a need for better co-operation between different corporate functions, namely technology management, MI, marketing and strategic planning, in order to indicate technology image impacts and also counteract firestorms from social media.","Nuortimo, KP; Härkönen, J",Strategic,10.37380/jisib.v9i1.401,Company media analysis; editorial media; learning machine; market intelligence; media-analysis; nuclear power; opinion mining; social media; web intelligence,5.0,,10,5,"HALMSTAD UNIV, SWEDEN","The abstract discusses the long-term implications of technology sentiment on corporate branding and decision-making, indicating a focus on strategic planning and the need for cooperation between various corporate functions.",wos-big data,60,20,Exploring new ways to utilise the market intelligence (MI) function in corporate decisions: Case opinion mining of nuclear power,2019
"Today, with the development of technology, digital sales have become an important part of companies' sales. In such an atmosphere, the development of marketing and sales information systems can help to improve marketing and sales in the field of digital markets. Paying attention to information system and combining it with marketing in the digital space can lead to an understanding of how information system and costumer behavior contributes to the purchase decision of a company's customers. In this regard, the current research has been carried out with the aim of discovering the model of the effect of information system on the consumer's purchase intention in the digital platform. In order to achieve the mentioned goal, firstly, based on the in-depth review of the subject literature, the conceptual model of the research has been developed. For the purchase intention, variables such as choosing a brand, intermediary or place of purchase, purchase amount, purchase time and payment method have been identified. Then, to measure the relationship between research variables, a research questionnaire was prepared and distributed among 250 customers who could be accessed. In this research, rank regression analysis method was used to analyze the data from the questionnaire. The results of this research show that information system and digital marketing directly affects the customer's purchase intention, also it is effective on the sales rate of digital shopping.","Mohamed, KM; Wong, WK; Pan, SH",Tactical,10.21003/ea.V200-02,digital shopping.

"Evolving tastes can change the relative importance of product features in shaping consumers' purchase decisions, which in turn can shift the relative attractiveness of products with different feature levels. The challenge lies in finding a reliable yet cost-effective way to monitor the weights consumers place on various product features. In the context of the U.S. automotive market, the authors explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as indicators of trends in the relative importance of the corresponding features (e.g., fuel economy, acceleration, cost to buy, cost to operate, body type). By augmenting marketing-mix data with feature search data in a market response model, they show substantial improvements in goodness-of-fit both in and out of sample. The authors find empirical support for the hypothesis that feature search trends are positively correlated with feature importance trends. They discuss how managers may make better decisions by monitoring feature search trends and leveraging those trends strategically.","Du, RY; Hu, Y; Damangir, S",Tactical,10.1509/jm.12.0459,Google trends; market response model; product feature; conjoint analysis; big data,5.0,,15,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,The abstract discusses the use of trends in online searches for feature-related keywords to inform marketing strategies in the automotive market.

"Purpose As two essential styles of firm decision-making, the relationships among effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance are unclear. It is helpful to deepen the understanding of reasoning theory and the process of decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between effectuation logic, causation logic and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on 31 independent empirical studies (including 11,600 samples) published by predecessors, meta-analysis is used to systematically integrate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance and explore the potential factors affecting their relationship. Findings The results show a positive correlation between two decision-making styles and firm performance and the influence of effectuation decision-making style in firm performance is slightly stronger. However, the application environment is different: in the emerging market, the causation decision-making style is more effective for firm performance management. When the firm chooses the effectuation decision-making style, it is more effective for performance management in the emerging market. In addition, the industry type, firm performance evaluation tools, national development level and firm scale and firm age can significantly moderate the impact of two decision-making styles on firm performance. Research limitations/implications Both decision-making logics are possible ways for firm to success. Still, the future needs to dig deeper into the black box that can unlock the decision-making styles to achieve firm performance or competitive advantage based on other factors of the decision-behavior-outcome business model, more longitudinal data and experiments.

"Marketers have recognized that the probability of a consumer's (or household's) purchase in a particular product category may be influenced by past purchases in the same category and also, purchases in other related categories. Past studies of crosscategory effects have focused on a limited number of product categories, and they have often ignored intertemporal effects in their analyses. Those studies have generally used multivariate logit or probit models, which are limited in their ability to analyze enormous data sets that contain consumer purchase records across a large number of categories and time periods. The availability of such enormous consumer shopping data sets and the value of analyzing the complex relationships across categories and over time (for example, for personalized promotions) suggest the need for computationally efficient modeling and estimation methods. Such models can capture associations among buying decisions across all product categories and over all time periods for which data are available, but they must also have a tractable and clear model structure that permits meaningful interpretation of the results. We explore the nature of intertemporal crossproduct patterns in an enormous consumer purchase data set using a model that adopts the structure of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs). Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach using the efficient estimation algorithm embodied in the CRBM enables us to process very large data sets and capture the consumer decision patterns for both predictive and descriptive purposes that might not otherwise be apparent. In addition to persistent intertemporal within-category effects, we find that there are also significant intertemporal cross effects between product categories.","Xia, FH; Chatterjee, R; May, JH",Tactical,10.1287/mksc.2019.1162,big data; sparsity; regularization; consumer decision patterns; deep learning,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses modeling and estimation methods to analyze consumer purchase patterns, which aligns with tactical decisions in marketing analytics and purchase prediction.

"Co-branding is an effective way for companies to expand their market and increase brand awareness. To study the conditions for a co-branding strategy, we develop a two-stage differential game model involving two manufacturers and an online platform to explore the choice of supply chain members, incorporating consumer reference price behavior. Interestingly, a result shows that manufacturers choose to co-brand if the combined impact factor is large and the revenue-sharing factor is medium, and the response of the platform for this choice is positive. Another finding is that although the impact of co-branding on operational decisions and consumers is uncertain, it is found that proper co-branding is a powerful tool for marketing strategies. In addition, the existence of reference price behavior improves operational decisions and influences the choice of a co-branding strategy. Furthermore, the extended model proves that big data marketing effectively expands the range of co-branding strategy selections.","Wang, XQ; Yin, HY; Ma, DQ",Strategic,10.1007/s10660-023-09759-5,Co-branding; Consumer reference price behavior; Differential game; Co-branding strategy selection,5.0,,10,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses co-branding strategies and their impact on market expansion and brand awareness, which aligns with long-term strategic planning for organizations.",wos-big data,60,25,Understanding consumer reference price behavior in co-branding: from the perspective of a dynamic supply chain,2023

It promises access to new knowledge along with some challenges, but let's not forget the important lessons of the past to ensure that we are advancing knowledge and making the right decisions from the data we have. In this paper, we submit that marketing's emphasis on statistical significance is misplaced, especially in the new world of big data. We include case examples to demonstrate how statistical significance is easy to find, but not necessarily important. We will also discuss the alternative route for generating robust knowledge. Specifically, we espouse the tradition pioneered by Andrew Ehrenberg of Many Sets of Data (MSoD) and descriptive models as the way to advance marketing science, and as a solid foundation for data interpretation in market research studies. We offer insights for market research practitioners and marketers alike, to ensure they are getting the best from their data for robust marketing decision-making.","Kennedy, R; Scriven, J; Nenycz-Thiel, M",Strategic,10.2501/IJMR-2014-041,,5.0,,10,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"The abstract discusses the broader implications of big data in marketing, emphasizing the importance of understanding and interpreting data for long-term decision-making and knowledge advancement, which aligns with strategic goals.",wos-big data,60,25,When 'significant' is not significant,2014
"Under the pressure of surging advertising costs and fierce market competition, a growing number of online merchants are trying to implement new advertising strategies to improve advertising efficiency and increase sales. In the context of the widespread acceptance of online platform membership, many merchants who lack the ability of Big Data choose to cooperate with platforms to implement targeted advertising strategy (TA strategy). Under this strategy, merchants can separately push different ads to the members and nonmembers, which breaks the past practice of pushing unified ads to the whole market under mass advertising strategy (MA strategy). The platform can obtain the member-only pricing right from the cooperation to enhance the attractiveness of its membership system and charge a higher advertising fee. This article discusses the interaction between the merchant and the platform and obtains the optimal decisions under MA and TA, respectively. Then, we compare the profit performance, advertising efficiency, and product sales between the two strategies. The result shows that the merchant will adopt TA when the gap in charging standards of the two strategies is narrow. Furthermore, when the gap is moderate, the dominance of TA relies on the small proportion of the member group. In addition, we find that the merchant prefers to reduce (increase) the advertising level to members (nonmembers) under TA, in comparison with MA. Through demand analysis under two strategies, a counterintuitive result shows that, in the TA scenario, the demand for products generated by the member group will decrease with the rise of the matching degree.","Hu, L; Sun, XH; Yu, H; Chung, SH",Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2022.3169392,Advertising; Electronic commerce; Costs; Analytical models; Sun; Pricing; Industries; E-commerce platform; loyalty programs; membership; targeted advertising,5.0,,15,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"The abstract discusses the implementation of targeted advertising strategies (TA) and compares it with mass advertising strategies (MA) in a structured manner.

"While it is clear that business analytics (BA), on average, adds value to firms, it is less clear why some firms perform better than others in leveraging their data assets. To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm's investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence a firm's data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms' marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance. That is, data-driven culture and firms' marketing innovation are relevant underlying serial mechanisms by which BA capabilities and pi-shaped skills influence innovative performance.","Abubakar, AM; Türkmen, A; Isik, V; Mikalef, P; Turel, O",Strategic,10.1080/0960085X.2024.2304030,Big data; Business analytics; data-oriented culture; Pi-shaped skills; Innovative performance; Socio-materiality theory,5.0,,10,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of leveraging business analytics through the development of a data-driven culture and pi-shaped skills, which are critical for innovation outcomes.

"Firms facing a dynamic marketplace associated with the increasing adoption of new-age technology, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of stakeholders seek guidance on the investment of scarce resources across these three primary dimensions. The key questions facing firms are: How can we capitalize on the three primary dimensions (the increasing new-age technology adoption, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of key stakeholders) and overcome their associated challenges to achieve sustainable firm growth? This study aims to revive the thinking based on the growth strategy literature in the current environment, by presenting a 4E growth strategy matrix comprising of entrenching, empowering, enterprising, and enriching growth strategies. We propose that a firm can invest resources to maximize on one, two, or all three primary dimensions to produce the four growth strategies. We present an organizing frame-work based on insights from our triangulated research approach. Each of the growth strategies discussed will result in building certain types of firm capabilities, which will then lead to serving the needs and well-being of the key stakeholders.

"Since its first entry into the literature discussion in the 1980s, customer relationship management (CRM) has found its way into nearly every company. Concepts like personalization, loyalty programs, and customer valuation are used regularly to interact with and prioritize customers. Unsurprisingly, this more widespread use has changed our understanding of CRM substantially and as a consequence, the field has seen a remarkable transformation in the past 3 decades. Yet, the CRM strategies implemented by many firms today are frequently still fundamentally based on an understanding of CRM from the early days. The purpose of this article is to outline the origins of CRM and to present the main wisdoms that firms believed to be true about customers 3 decades ago. I then discuss the key insights that academics and managers have obtained in recent years that increasingly challenge those wisdoms. The article ends with an outlook of CRM in years to come and presents some of the major challenges practitioners and researchers will have to deal with in the near future.

"This paper argues that choice modelling is a useful approach for all social sciences, while at the same time disciplines such as sociology and political science can contribute significantly to the future development of choice modelling. So far choice modelling has mainly been applied in disciplines that investigate types of consumption choices, be it marketing to investigate preferences for new products, transportation to analyse mode choices, or environmental economics to elicit preferences for public goods. However, using the information that can be gained from individual choices among mutually exclusive alternatives has gained increasing popularity in other disciplines as a powerful tool to test theoretical hypotheses and generate insights into individual behaviour. Examples are the acceptance of refugee shelters in peoples' neighbourhood, the choice of where to commit a crime or the evolution of social networks. A good point of departure for an expansion of choice modelling within the social sciences is the common foundation that many disciplines share that are gathered under the umbrella of social sciences. Research traditions and theoretical models include rational choice concepts, and choice modelling can be linked to crosscutting methods, including agent-based models, network analysis, and machine learning. At the same time, disciplines can complement each other in studying choice behaviour, as they can contribute concepts and tools less familiar to the other disciplines. Finally, all social science disciplines face challenges when it comes to issues such as causal analysis, heterogeneity in decision rules, joint decision making, or big data. Choice modelling and a cross-disciplinary dialogue can contribute to meeting these challenges.","Liebe, U; Meyerhoff, J",Operational,10.1016/j.jocm.2021.100270,Causal analysis; Context effects; Decision rules; Machine learning; Network analysis; Rational choice; Social sciences,5.0,,60,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the application of choice modeling as a precise tool for analyzing individual decisions and behaviors, which aligns closely with operational decision-making processes.

"The work considers modification of the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to the so-called System 1 (S1) approach. S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels happy, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data.","Lipovetsky, S",Operational,10.1080/23270012.2019.1702112,System 1; BWS; max diff; MNL utility; choice probability; prioritization,10.0,,60,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) and its modification to a System 1 approach, focusing on practical applications for data eliciting and analysis of prioritization among items.
