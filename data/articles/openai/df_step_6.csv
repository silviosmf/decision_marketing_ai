Enhancing consumer behavior analysis by data mining techniques,Hsieh N.-C.; Chu K.-N.,2009,,"Analyzing consumer behavior is a costly implementation of sophisticated information technology, which requires detailed planning and business knowledge for successful adoption. The current trend on consumer behavior analysis has been recognized on the business problem rather than on the information technology. This study presents a two-stage framework of consumer behavior analysis, and the key feature is a cascade involving self-organizing map (SOM) neural network to divide customers into homogeneous groups of customers and a decision-tree simplified method to identify relevant knowledge. Identifying consumers by this approach is helpful characteristic of customers and facilitates marketing strategy development.",Consumer behavior analysis; Credit card; Data mining; Decision tree; Neural network,,scopus-data mining,Tactical,"The study presents a framework for analyzing consumer behavior, which involves structured methods like self-organizing maps and decision trees.

Data mining techniques for customer relationship management,Rygielski C.; Wang J.-C.; Yen D.C.,2002,10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00038-6,"Advancements in technology have made relationship marketing a reality in recent years. Technologies such as data warehousing, data mining, and campaign management software have made customer relationship management a new area where firms can gain a competitive advantage. Particularly through data mining-the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases-organizations can identify valuable customers, predict future behaviors, and enable firms to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. The automated, future-oriented analyses made possible by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events typically provided by history-oriented tools such as decision support systems. Data mining tools answer business questions that in the past were too time-consuming to pursue. Yet, it is the answers to these questions make customer relationship management possible. Various techniques exist among data mining software, each with their own advantages and challenges for different types of applications. A particular dichotomy exists between neural networks and chi-square automated interaction detection (CHAID). While differing approaches abound in the realm of data mining, the use of some type of data mining is necessary to accomplish the goals of today's customer relationship management philosophy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The role of insight teams in integrating diverse marketing information management techniques,Fleisher C.S.; Wright S.; Allard H.T.,2008,10.1108/03090560810877187,"Purpose - The paper seeks to address the viability of planning and executing the integration of four often independent marketing information management techniques, i.e. competitive intelligence (CI), customer relationship management (CRM), data mining (DM) and market research (MR). Design/methodology/approach - The research presented is a longitudinal, exploratory and descriptive case study, covering a three-year period during a critical development phase of a medium-size, national employer association which sought to improve the quality of marketing-based insights to its strategic planning capability as well as improve economic outcomes. Findings - It is possible to achieve profitable and capability enhancing integration of diverse marketing information management techniques. Successful integration and the use of a highly focused cross-functional team generated better market strategies and bottom line benefits. Practical implications - The need to generate greater insight from popular marketing information management and planning techniques is routinely experienced by marketing and other executive decision makers. This article provides a multi-year roadmap of the successful execution of technique integration, including identifying barriers that arose as well as suggesting solutions for achieving progress. Originality/value - There are very few case studies published that demonstrate the successful evolution and integration of CI, CRM, DM and MR into the enterprise's strategy-making process.

Interactive media usage among millennial consumers,Moore M.,2012,10.1108/07363761211259241,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine a comprehensive model of millennial usage of interactive technologies in the current marketing environment based upon actual behavior. Design/methodology/approach: A data mining approach using decision tree analysis (DTA) generates two comparative models (i.e. millennial versus generation X and millennial versus baby boomers) of interactive media usage across 21 technology applications. A large national sample (n=3,289) sourced from the Kantar Retail IQ constitutes the data for the models. Findings: Millennial respondents indicate significantly higher usage of interactive media compared to both generation X and boomers across 14 applications. Models indicate that millennials use interactive technologies for utilitarian/information gathering purposes as well as for entertainment. However, they are less likely to purchase online compared to their older counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Models provide evidence that both supports and extends previous research into interactive media from a uses and gratifications perspective. Findings suggest theoretical directions for research for economic versus emotional uses of interactive media. Practical implications: Findings suggest that while millennials are adept at using technology for research and interactive purposes they tend to buy in stores, presenting opportunities for multiple channel marketers and challenges for those who market online exclusively. Originality/value: The paper provides a realistic, comprehensive empirical model of interactive consumer behaviors across three prominent US cohorts within the current generational cycle. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Cohort analysis; Decision trees; Individual behaviour; Interactive marketing; Marketing starategy; Millennial generation; User studies,,scopus-data mining,Tactical,"The study provides insights into millennial usage of interactive technologies, which can inform specific marketing strategies and targets, such as optimizing channels for marketing and understanding consumer behavior across generations.",10,70,15,0,5
Applying rough sets to market timing decisions,Shen L.; Loh H.T.,2004,10.1016/S0167-9236(03)00089-7,"A lot of research has been done to predict economic development.

Enhanced decision making using data mining: Applications for retailers,Anderson J.; Kotsiopulos A.,2002,,"As the economy has tightened, retailers have been challenged in recent years to be more strategic in their planning. They struggle to find answers to: • Who can I consider a loyal customer? • What kind of marketing strategy is most likely to increase sales? • What can customer-purchasing patterns reveal about improving inventory control? • What is the most effective way to manage customer relations to increase revenues? (Rabinovitch, 1999). With the exponential growth in the amount of data being collected, improvements in technology, and research in machine learning, retailers are now able to reduce the ever growing difficult and complex decision making process by recruiting the efforts of data mining (Barry & Linoff, 1997). Data mining is a computerized technology that uses complicated algorithms to find relationships and trends in large data bases, real or perceived, previously unknown to the retailer, to promote decision support. Currently being utilized by such retail giants as Federated Department Stores, Nordstrom, and Wal-Mart, Inc., data mining is touted to be one of the greatest technologies to hit the retailing industry this decade (Rabinovitch, 1999). The purpose of this study is to critique data mining technology in comparison with more familiar analytical tools for strategic decision making by small to medium size retailers.

Uplift modeling with value-driven evaluation metrics,Gubela R.M.; Lessmann S.,2021,10.1016/j.dss.2021.113648,"Measuring the success of targeted marketing actions is challenging. Research on prescriptive analytics recommends uplift models to guide targeting decisions. Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers' behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets. They further contribute to the growing field of interpretable data science by uncovering interdependencies between covariates, ITE, and profit and by clarifying whether customers are worth targeting because of high responsiveness or high value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Evaluation metric; Interpretable data science; Target marketing; Uplift modeling,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-data science,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the application of uplift models and business-centric evaluation metrics to improve targeted marketing decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into actionable targets.",10,70,15,0,5

Why domain knowledge is essential for data scientists in marketing,Ahlemeyer-Stubbe A.; Müller A.,2022,,"What good is the most scientifically valuable analysis if it piles up in marketers’ inboxes but does not give them the necessary foundation for their decisions? Such a situation is no use to data scientists and certainly no use to the marketing team. The root of the issue is that two worlds meet here that speak completely different languages. Only if data scientists can ‘translate’ their results into marketing language will their work be successful. Marketing teams do not need as much information as possible; rather, they require just the right information, preferably with recommendations for action that can guide their decisions. To select the information that is truly useful for marketing and communicate it in an understandable way, data scientists must have more than expertise in analytics methods and tools (which is assumed and therefore not discussed in detail here); they also need to know about marketing objectives and have a comprehensive contextual understanding of their company’s industry and sector, including competitors. Knowledge of the general situation in the world as well as the legal, political and religious particularities of the countries in which the company operates is also required. In short, analytics results that truly drive marketing can only be delivered by data scientists with domain knowledge. Using a case study from the field, this paper shows how data scientists can gain the domain knowledge they need to be successful in marketing and in which aspects of their work it helps them perform more effectively. © Henry Stewart Publications.",computer science; data scientist; domain knowledge in data science; marketing analytics; predictive modelling; statistics; success factors,Henry Stewart Publications,scopus-data science,Tactical,"The abstract discusses how data scientists need to translate their analytical results into actionable insights for marketing teams, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

Data-Driven Personas for Enhanced User Understanding: Combining Empathy with Rationality for Better Insights to Analytics,Jansen B.J.; Salminen J.O.; Jung S.-G.,2020,10.2478/dim-2020-0005,"Persona is a common human-computer interaction technique for increasing stakeholders’ understanding of audiences, customers, or users. Applied in many domains, such as e-commerce, health, marketing, software development, and system design, personas have remained relatively unchanged for several decades. However, with the increasing popularity of digital user data and data science algorithms, there are new opportunities to progressively shift personas from general representations of user segments to precise interactive tools for decision-making. In this vision, the persona profile functions as an interface to a fully functional analytics system. With this research, we conceptually investigate how data-driven personas can be leveraged as analytics tools for understanding users.

Model selection using database characteristics: Developing a classification tree for longitudinal incidence data,Schwartz E.M.; Bradlow E.T.; Fader P.S.,2014,10.1287/mksc.2013.0825,"When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use? And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend the ""winning model"" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that recommends when to use which model. By doing the ""legwork"" of obtaining this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some model features (e.g., the ""back-and-forth"" migration between latent states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e.g., the inclusion of an ""off"" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the method's broad potential by providing a general ""recipe"" for researchers to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM framework). © 2014 INFORMS.",Business intelligence; Classification tree; Data science; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Hierarchical Bayesian methods; Machine learning; Model selection; Posterior predictive model checking; Random forest,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,scopus-data science,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a decision tree tool that helps analysts select the appropriate model for forecasting repeat purchasing, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing analytics and purchase prediction.",10,70,15,0,5
Forecasting Business Persistency at HDFC Life: Smart Insights Powered by Data Analytics,Karulkar Y.; Jain S.,2020,10.1177/2277977920958573,"The life insurance industry is inherently a data-driven industry with various applications for analytical decision-making. Data science has influenced all business functions in an insurance organization to provide a distinct competitive advantage and push the industry towards the vision of ‘Insure Tech’. This case revolves around one such application of analytics in HDFC analytics dealing with championing the initiative for forecasting and analysis of Business Persistency. The persistency ratio is actually a fairly simple, yet very important metric that provides a snapshot of the health of the insurance industry. Considering the importance of this parameter, it became extremely important for HDFC Life to understand the factors behind persistency numbers and what lies ahead for the organization. The existing forecasting techniques were biased by the nature of work and did not give a significantly accurate and realistic number. The top management found this to be challenging for decision-making and decided that this required the intervention of the Business Insights department. Mr. Francis Rodrigues, SVP—Data Labs, Business Insights and Innovation was given the task to take over the pilot project and increase usage of analytical tools for Persistency Analysis. While Quarter 1 results have been significant, Mr. Francis Rodrigues still wonders whether he captured all the internal and external measures to obtain effective results. Has he done enough and how many more areas can analytics be applied for in the insurance domain? Research Question/Purpose: The current methods of persistency calculation are biased by the nature of work and deflect by a huge margin from the numbers actually achieved. There are no realistic forecasts for the coming year making the management uncertain with the decisions they take for strategic purposes. Theory: Time-indexed collection data help in predicting persistency numbers which are also influenced by some important variables behind collection follow-up and categories of customers. Type of the Case: Applied problem solving. Protagonist: Not needed. Options: Due to the availability of time-indexed data, time series was considered to be the best approach to forecast values into the future. However, that would only solve one half of the problem. It was also important to understand the parameters affecting persistency numbers, important variables behind persistency collections and classify the customers based on such variables. With this knowledge, classification models were also taken into consideration. Discussions and Case Questions: Besides time-indexed collection data which other variables amongst policy and demographic parameters influence persistency parameters? How can insights be drawn about the factors that are actually affecting the persistency numbers? Will calculating and sharing monthly persistency numbers for the coming year improve the percentage of customers remitting payment on time? By classifying customers into various categories with regards to the frequency of follow-up required for premium collection can a favourable segment be carved out? © 2020 SAGE Publications.",business insights; data analytics; financial analytics; Life insurance; marketing analytics; persistency; sales forecasting; time series analysis,SAGE Publications Ltd,scopus-data science,Tactical,"The case focuses on improving the persistency ratio through analytical decision-making, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into structured targets.

Evaluating the creditworthiness of a client in the insurance industry using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,Doskocil R.,2017,10.5755/j01.ee.28.1.14194,"The article deals with the issue of a client's creditworthiness assessment in the insurance industry. The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of new factors which have relation to a client’s creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client’s creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client’s creditworthiness in the insurance industry.

Time to market prediction using type-2 fuzzy sets,Baguley P.; Page T.; Koliza V.; Maropoulos P.,2006,10.1108/17410380610662924,"Purpose - Time to market is the essential aim of any new product introduction process. Performance measures are simple quantities that indicate the state of manufacturing organisations and are used as the basis of decision-making at this crucial early stage of the process. Fuzzy set theory is a method for using qualitative data and subjective opinion. Fuzzy sets have been used extensively in manufacturing for applications including control, decision-making, and estimation. Type-2 fuzzy sets are a novel extension of type-1 fuzzy sets. Aims to examine this subject. Design/methodology/approach - This research explores the increased use of type-2 fuzzy sets in manufacturing. In particular, type-2 fuzzy sets are used to model ""the words that mean different things to different people"". Findings - A model that can leverage design process knowledge and predict time to market from performance measures is a potentially valuable tool for decision making and continuous improvement. A number of data sources, such as process maps, from previous research into time to market in a high technology products company, are used to structure and build a type-2 fuzzy logic model for the prediction of time to market.

A decision support system for sales forecasting through fuzzy neural networks with asymmetric fuzzy weights,Kuo R.J.; Xue K.C.,1998,10.1016/S0167-9236(98)00067-0,"Sales forecasting plays a very prominent role in business strategy. Numerous investigations addressing this problem have generally employed statistical methods, such as regression or autoregressive and moving average (ARMA). However, sales forecasting is very complicated owing to influence by internal and external environments. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have also been applied in sales forecasting since their promising performances in the areas of control and pattern recognition. However, further improvement is still necessary since unique circumstances, e.g., promotion, cause a sudden change in the sales pattern. Thus, this study utilizes fuzzy logic a proposed fuzzy neural network (FNN) for the sake of learning fuzzy IF-THEN rules obtained from the marketing experts with respect to promotion. The result from FNN is further integrated with the forecast from ANN using the time series data and the promotion length through the other ANN.

Celebrity selection in social media ecosystems: a flexible and interactive framework,Shukla S.; Dubey A.,2022,10.1108/JRIM-04-2020-0074,"Purpose: Quantitative objective studies on the problem of celebrity selection are lacking. Furthermore, existing research does not recognize the group decision-making nature and the possibility of customer involvement in celebrity or influencer selection for social media marketing. This study conceptualizes celebrity selection as a multi-attribute group decision-making problem while deriving the final ranking of celebrities/influencers using interactive and flexible criteria based on the value tradeoff approach. The article thus proposes and demonstrates a quantitative objective method of celebrity selection for a brand or campaign in an interactive manner incorporating customer's preferences as well. Design/methodology/approach: Each decision-maker's preferences for celebrity selection criteria are objectively captured and converted into an overall group preference using a modified generalized fuzzy evaluation method (MGFEM). The final ranking of celebrities is then derived from an interactive and criteria-based value tradeoff approach using the flexible and interactive tradeoff method. Findings: The approach gives a different ranking of celebrities for two campaigns based on group members' perceived importance of the selection criteria in different scenarios. This group includes decision-makers (DMs) from the brand, marketing communication agency and brand's customers. Further, each group member has an almost equal say in the decision-making based on fuzzy evaluation and an interactive and flexible value tradeoff approach to celebrity selection for receiving a rank order. Research limitations/implications: The approach uses secondary data on celebrities and hypothetical scenarios. Comparison with other methods is difficult, as no other study proposes a multi-criteria group decision-making approach to celebrity selection especially in a social media context. Practical implications: This approach can help DMs make more informed, objective and effective decisions on celebrity selection for their brands or campaigns. It recognizes that there are multiple stakeholders, including the end customers, each of whose views is objectively considered in the aspects of group decision-making through a fuzzy evaluation method. Further, this study provides a selection mechanism for a given context of endorsement by objectively and interactively encapsulating stakeholder preferences. Originality/value: This robust and holistic approach to celebrity selection can help DMs objectively make consensual decisions with partial or complete information. This quantitative approach contributes to the literature on selection mechanisms of influencers, celebrities, social media opinion leaders etc. by providing a methodological aid that encompasses aspects of interactive group decision-making for a given context. Moreover, this method is useful to DMs and stakeholders in understanding and incorporating the effect of nature or context of the brand and the campaign type in the selection of a celebrity or an influencer. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Celebrity selection; FITradeoff; Fuzzy logic; Group decision-making; Multi-attribute; Social media marketing campaign,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-fuzzy logic,Tactical,"The study presents a method for celebrity selection that interprets strategic goals into actionable targets, employing a multi-attribute group decision-making approach.

Design/methodology/approach - First, referring numerous studies, conventional IPA has some erroneous assumptions, the customer satisfaction of attribute performance has the characteristic of three-factor theory and the novel approach which integrates natural logarithmic transformation and partial correlation analysis is feasible for acquiring the implicitly derived importance of attributes. Second, according the fact and nature of fuzziness in human perception, this study applies fuzzy set theory to revise conventional IPA. Finally, the FIPA is proposed and subsequently implemented in a Taiwanese hot spring hotel case study.

A hybrid approach to achieve organizational agility: An empirical study of a food company,Nejatian M.; Zarei M.H.; Nejati M.; Zanjirchi S.M.,2018,10.1108/BIJ-09-2016-0147,"Purpose: In today’s intense global competition, agility is advocated as a fundamental characteristic for business survival and competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical methodology to achieve and enhance organizational agility based on strategic objectives. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the organization being studied are recognized and classified under the perspectives of balanced scorecard (BSC). Critical success factors are then identified by ranking the KPIs according to their importance in achieving organizational strategic objectives using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In the second step, three houses of quality (HOQs) are constructed sequentially to identify and rank the main agile attributes, agile enablers, and improvement paths. In addition, in order to translate linguistics judgments of practitioners into numerical values in building HOQs, fuzzy logic is employed. Findings: The capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a case of a multi-national food company in Iran. Through the application, the company could find the most suitable improvement paths to improve its organizational agility. Research limitations/implications: A limited number of KPIs were chosen due to computational and visual constraints related to HOQs. Another limitation, similar to other agility studies, which facilitate decision making among agility metrics, was that the metrics were more industry-specific and less inclusive. Practical implications: A strong practical advantage for the application of the methodology over directly choosing agility metrics without linking them is that through the methodology, the right metrics were selected that match organization’s core values and marketing objectives. While metrics may ostensibly seem unrelated or inappropriate, they actually contributed to the right areas where there were gaps between the current and desired level of agility. It would otherwise be impossible to choose the right metrics without a structured methodology. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel methodology for achieving organizational agility. By utilizing and linking several tools such as BSC, fuzzy TOPSIS, and quality function deployment (QFD), the proposed approach enables organizations to identify the most appropriate agile attributes, agile enablers, and subsequently agile improvement paths. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Agile organization; Balanced scorecard; Enterprise agility; House of quality; Organizational agility; Quality function deployment,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-fuzzy logic,Strategic,"The abstract discusses a methodology for enhancing organizational agility, which is closely aligned with long-term strategic planning and decision-making.

A modified CRITIC with a reference point based on fuzzy logic and hamming distance,Sharkasi N.; Rezakhah S.,2022,10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109768,"Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims to support decision-makers more effectively. This paper presents modifications for the criteria ranking methods, CRITIC and Distance-correlation CRITIC (D-CRITIC). These modifications involve the normalization procedure to silence criteria attribution by utilizing fuzzy logic and the hamming distance. Also, some adjustment to the weighting technique of the CRITIC method is done to capture linear and nonlinear correlations more precisely. These modifications that are applied to the CRITIC method by considering some reference point (RP), produced our proposed (M-CRITIC-RP) method. An illustrative example to rank performance criteria of display advertisement for a digital marketing campaign is used to demonstrate the method's workability. Comparative analysis with appropriate MCDM methods reveals that the distance correlation values for the weights of the M-CRITIC-RP and comparative methods exhibit higher consistency than those between other criteria ranking methods. Moreover, M-CRITIC-RP has a high average value of Spearman rank statistic, indicating high rank consistency. Regarding accuracy, the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and the Log Accuracy Ratio (LAR) error metrics show lower values for M-CRITIC-RP in comparison to the corresponding values of other criteria ranking methods. M-CRITIC-RP demonstrates sensitivity with changes in the number of alternatives and also to variations in the RPs. The results of the sensitivity analysis guide the analyst to pay ample attention when selecting the RP. Findings also suggest considering a sufficient sample size for better accuracy and consistency of weights and ranks.

Intelligent fashion recommender system: Fuzzy logic in personalized garment design,Wang L.C.; Zeng X.Y.; Koehl L.; Chen Y.,2015,10.1109/THMS.2014.2364398,"This paper proposes a new intelligent fashion recommender system to select the most relevant garment design scheme for a specific consumer in order to deliver new personalized garment products. This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape.

The effect of social media marketing on voting intention; an application of multidimensional panel data,Moslehpour M.; Tiwari A.K.; Ebrahimi Pourfaez S.,2024,10.1108/IJOEM-08-2022-1250,"Purpose: This study examines the effect of social media marketing on voting intention applying a combination of fuzzy logic methodology and a multidimensional panel data model. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multidimensional panel data method that includes several fixed effects. The dependent variable is a multifaceted construct that measures the participants’ intention to vote. The independent variables are electronic word of mouth (eWOM), customisation (CUS), entertainment (ENT), interaction (INT), trendiness (TRD), candidate’s perceived image (CPI), religious beliefs (RB), gender and age. The grouping variables that signify fixed effects are employment status, level of education, mostly used social media and religion. First, the significance of said fixed effects was tested through an ANOVA process. Then, the main model was estimated, including the significant grouping variables as fixed effects. Findings: Employment status and level of education were significant fixed effects. Also, eWOM, ENT, INT, CPI, RB and gender significantly affected participants’ voting intention. Research limitations/implications: Being based on a questionnaire that asked participants about how they perceive different aspects of social media, the present study is limited to their perceptions. Therefore, further studies covering the voters’ behaviour in action could be efficient complements to the present study. Practical implications: The findings could guide the political parties into prioritizing the aspects of social media in forming an effective campaign resulting in being elected. Social implications: The findings have the potential to help the public in making better informed decisions when voting. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate applications for social media which are beyond leisure time fillers. Originality/value: Fuzzy logic and multidimensional panel data estimates are this study’s novelty and originality.

An intelligent approach to ERP software selection through fuzzy ANP,Ayaǧ Z.; Özdemir R.G.,2007,10.1080/00207540600724849,"During the implementations of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, most companies have experienced some problems, one of which is how to determine the best ERP software satisfying their needs and expectations. Because improperly selected ERP software may have an impact on the time required, and the costs and market share of a company, selecting the best desirable ERP software has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, selecting ERP software is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and in the literature, many methods have been introduced to evaluate this kind of problem, one of which is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been widely used in MCDM selection problems. However, in this paper, we use a fuzzy extension of an analytic network process (ANP), a more general form of AHP, which uses uncertain human preferences as input information in the decision-making process, because the AHP cannot accommodate the variety of interactions, dependencies, and feedback between higher- and lower-level elements. Instead of using the classical eigenvector prioritization method in the AHP, only employed in the prioritization stage of ANP, a fuzzy-logic method providing more accuracy on judgements is applied. The resulting fuzzy ANP enhances the potential of the conventional ANP for dealing with imprecise and uncertain human comparison judgements. In short, in this paper, an intelligent approach to ERP software selection through a fuzzy ANP is proposed by taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative elements to evaluate ERP software alternatives.",Analytic network process; Enterprise resource planning; Fuzzy logic; Multiple-criteria decision-making; Software selection,,scopus-fuzzy logic,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the selection of ERP software using a fuzzy analytic network process, which involves structured decision-making and evaluation of alternatives based on multiple criteria.

Allocation of marketing budgets to maximize customer equity,Koosha H.; Albadvi A.,2020,10.1007/s12351-017-0356-z,"Relationship marketing considers customers as the main asset of organizations and the source of their profitability. Allocation of marketing budgets to these valuable assets is critical; because the way companies allocate their marketing budgets to customers affects their profitability. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments in a long-term view and a dynamic process. The contribution of the model is as follows: (1) unlike the previous modeling efforts where a predefined budget level was assigned to acquisition and retention, the suggested model sets and allocates marketing budgets simultaneously; (2) the model is multi-period which means the strategies for setting and allocation of marketing budgets may be different in each period. The proposed approach aims at maximizing customer equity in a long-term planning horizon with several periods. Decision variables determine how the budgets should be assigned to customer acquisition and retention in each period. Formulation of the model is followed by a numerical illustration. Since the model is nonlinear and non-convex, none of exact mathematical programming approaches may solve it. Therefore, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing approaches were employed. The results showed the effectiveness of the model compared with other extant models. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Budget allocation; Customer acquisition; Customer equity; Customer retention; Decision calculus; Genetic algorithm; Simulated annealing,Springer,scopus-genetic algorithm,Strategic,"The abstract discusses a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments with a long-term view, which aligns with strategic planning and organizational goals.",70,20,5,0,5
AN APPLICATION OF APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IN MULTI-PERIOD MULTI-PRODUCT ADVERTISING BUDGETING,Khalilzadeh M.; Neghabi H.; Ahadi R.,2023,10.3934/jimo.2021202,"Advertising has always been considered a key part of marketing strategy and played a prominent role in the success or failure of products. This paper investigates a multi-product and multi-period advertising budget allocation, determining the amount of advertising budget for each product through the time horizon. Imperative factors including life cycle stage, BCG matrix class, competitors’ reactions, and budget constraints affect the joint chain of decisions for all products to maximize the total profits. To do so, we define a stochastic sequential resource allocation problem and use an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to alleviate the huge size of the problem and multi-dimensional uncertainties of the environment. These uncertainties are the reactions of competitors based on the current status of the market and our decisions, as well as the stochastic effectiveness (rewards) of the taken action. We apply an approximate value iteration (AV I) algorithm on a numerical example and compare the results with four different policies to highlight our managerial contributions. In the end, the validity of our proposed approach is assessed against a genetic algorithm.

Joint Optimization of Bus Scheduling and Targeted Bus Exterior Advertising,Hu Z.; Huang D.; Wang S.,2023,10.1061/JTEPBS.TEENG-7812,"Bus exterior advertising provides a powerful way to establish brand awareness because it can reach a mass of audiences with a high frequency. For a certain advertisement category, advertising effectiveness is largely dependent upon its exposure times to the target audience who takes interest in advertisement, which is termed targeted advertising. Given that the distribution of target audiences over a city varies among different advertisement categories, a practical way of enhancing overall advertising effectiveness is to deploy a bus with certain advertisement category to the bus line that best fits its target area. This gives rise to a decision-making problem of targeted bus exterior advertising and bus scheduling. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a biobjective optimization model with objectives of maximizing the quantified advertising effectiveness and minimizing the number of bus fleet size to cover all trips. The advertising effectiveness is quantified using audience demographic data. The deadheading of buses is also enabled in the scheduling process to facilitate both objectives. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-Large Neighborhood Search (NSGA-II-LNS) algorithm is developed to solve the biobjective problem with the incorporation of large neighborhood search operators into the framework of the NSGA-II to improve solution quality.

Optimal payment time and replenishment decisions for retailer’s inventory system under trade credit and carbon emission constraints,Jabbarzadeh A.; Aliabadi L.; Yazdanparast R.,2021,10.1007/s12351-019-00457-5,"This study presents a multi-item inventory and pricing model by considering marketing, service activities, trade credit, carbon emissions, and the restrictions of production cost and storage space. In the proposed model, shortages are allowed and demand rate is a power function of service and marketing costs, and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize retailer’s payments time, service and marketing expenditure, and replenishment decisions in order to maximize retailer’s total profit and minimize carbon emissions, simultaneously. Model is developed in a fuzzy environment under carbon tax regulation when the length of credit period provided by supplier is less than or equal to the length of time in which no shortage happens. To solve the proposed model, we first transform the original problem into a multi-objective Signomial Geometric Programming (SGP) problem using fuzzy and hybrid parameters, which minimizes both the mean value and the total dispersion value of the objective function. Then a global optimization problem method has been used to solve the SGP problem.

Coordinated optimisation of platform-driven product line planning by bilevel programming,Miao C.; Du G.; Jiao R.J.; Zhang T.,2017,10.1080/00207543.2017.1294770,"Product line planning (PLP) aims at an optimal combination of product feature offerings, suggesting itself to be a determinant decision for a company to satisfy diverse customer needs and gain competitive advantages. Fulfilment of planned product lines must make trade-offs between product variety and production costs. To balance the costs of product lines, manufacturers often adopt a product platform configuration (PPC) approach to redesign product and process platforms by adding new modules to the legacy platforms. The PPC is an effective means of providing product variety while controlling the manufacturing costs. The PLP and PPC problems have traditionally been investigated separately in the marketing research and engineering design fields. It is important to coordinate PLP and PPC decisions within a coherent optimisation framework. This paper proposes a bilevel mixed 0–1 nonlinear programming model to formulate coordinated optimisation for platform-driven product line planning. The upper level deals with the PLP problem by maximising the profit of an entire product line, whilst the lower level copes with the multiple product platforms optimisation for the optimal PPC in accordance with the upper level decisions of product line structure. To solve this bilevel programming model, a bilevel genetic algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution.

However, the logistics decisions in the vending machine service industry are challenging, coupled with complex constraints, considering the machine deployment location, product selection, shelf display allocation, and the elasticity of demands and spaces. This paper presents a bi-layer optimization model addressing the challenges associated with deployment location, product selection, and shelf display for a vending machine system consisting of more than ten thousand vending machines. The upper layer model selects appropriate locations for machine deployment, while the lower layer model considers product selection and shelf display in individual machines.

Exploring the value of IoT data as an enabler of the transformation towards servitization: an action design research approach,Chen K.-L.; Lassen A.; Li C.; Møller C.,2023,10.1080/0960085X.2022.2046515,"Servitization is a well-recognised phenomenon in the manufacturing industry. Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company.

Social Media Enhances Consumer Behaviour during e-Transactions: An Empirical Evidence from Bahrain,Alshaer D.S.; Hamdan A.; Razzaque A.,2020,10.1142/S0219649220400122,"This study aims to investigate the role of social media on consumer behaviour in the restaurants industry of Bahrain. The objectives of this research were to assess importance of social media as a marketing tool for Bahrain's restaurants for influencing consumer purchase decision-making. Such an objective was reached by the scholars who randomly collected data from 224 respondents in Bahrain, who use social media, using a survey instrument. The findings of the descriptive analysis revealed that social media affects consumers' decision-making, such that the consumers use the social media to study new products, services, and particularly new brands. Also, ongoing consumer discussions reveal how social media exposes the pros and cons of products, services, and brands, so consumers are comfortable with their online decisions, since they can select broads before settling on what is the best price, quality, etc. Moreover, the social media speeds the spread of information unlike any other mass media; ensuring that new knowledge reaches consumers, hence enhancing competition among retailers in the restaurant industry. This study concludes that social media plays a vital role in promoting consumer welfare and decision-making. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.",consumer behaviour; Kingdom of Bahrain; Social Internet of Things; social media,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Reinvigorating sustainability in Internet of Things marketing: Framework for multi-round real-time bidding with game machine learning,Zhang R.; Jiang C.; Zhang J.; Fan J.; Ren J.; Xia H.,2023,10.1016/j.iot.2023.100921,"Auction-based incentive mechanisms can satisfy the heterogeneous demands of both Demand Side Platforms (DSP) and Supply Side Platforms (SSP) in Internet of Things (IoT) marketing. However, DSP platforms often need help with two issues during the auction process: low enthusiasm and unreasonable bidding. To address these problems, we use the second-price sealed auction and propose a framework for multi-round real-time bidding with game machine learning. We introduce a multi-round advertising bidding mechanism incorporating reputation incentive rules to enhance DSP enthusiasm. The aim is to stimulate DSP participation and deter malicious DSP behavior, ensuring fairness and transparency in the bidding process. Subsequently, we design an auction screening model and adopt a multi-round auction format to ensure that only capable and willing advertising demand partners can participate, thus guaranteeing the reasonableness of DSP bids. Furthermore, we design a real-time bidding mechanism to adapt to the dynamic nature of the IoT marketing market. This mechanism transforms the problem of maximizing DSP revenue under budget constraints into a parameter adjustment problem based on a Markov Decision Process. We then utilize the Double Deep Q Network method to obtain the optimal bidding strategy for DSPs. Ultimately, the results demonstrate that our framework improves the final transaction price by 14.71%, increases the expected click-through rate by an average of 19.35%, and reduces the average cost per thousand impressions by 20.34%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Deep reinforcement learning; IoT marketing; Multi-round auctions; Real-time bidding,Elsevier B.V.,scopus-Internet of Things,Tactical,"The abstract discusses a specific mechanism for improving real-time bidding strategies in IoT marketing, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at translating strategic goals into actionable targets.

Smart cities and 5G networks: An emerging technological area?,Kochetkov D.; Vuković D.; Sadekov N.; Levkiv H.,2019,10.2298/IJGI1903289K,"The term “smart city” has recently become greatly widespread in academic and political discourse. Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management. © 2019, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Death of the traditional newspaper: A strategic assessment; [Die dood van die tradisionele koerant:’n Strategiese assessering],LotRiet R.,2018,10.17159/2224-7912/2018/v58n4-1a7,"The newspaper industry in South Africa has been placed under severe pressure with the digital era in recent years. Circulation figures have dropped and profits have decreased. The influence of the Internet and news online could have a significant impact on the manner in which newspaper publishers generate revenue and profits in the future. If the current decrease in circulation continues, there could be as little as 750 000 newspapers in circulation in South Africa by the year 2020. The latest figures still confirm the decline in all classes of newspapers: daily newspapers, pdf replicas, weekly newspapers, weekend and free newspapers. The study shows that one-fifth of SA has partially or completely migrated to online news, which can be the dominant factor for the decrease in circulation rates. The dilemma manifests itself in South Africa’s traditional largest daily newspapers in an increasingly thinning newspaper versus higher than inflationary price increases. The latter culminates in price sensitive readers who respond by purchasing their favourite daily newspaper on selective days only. The Internet of Things in South Africa will grow exponentially as data costs decrease and Internet access improves so that online media usage will grow accordingly. The growing phenomenon of digital media is changing the market landscape significantly and could have dire consequences for the newspaper publisher who does not manage any migration strategically. Is this a case of the famous newspaper cliché: “stop the press!” – especially for Afrikaans daily newspapers? The Internet undermines newspapers’advertising revenues and news became a commodity that could dramatically change the traditional business model. From the contrasting market trends pointed out in the article, it is clear that this complex news ecosystem requires interaction with the readers to pinpoint future consumer journeys. A major challenge is advertisers who now reach larger audiences with digital and broadcast media at a much lower price than those of newspaper advertising. The worrying aspect for the industry is that a loss of advertising revenue in printed newspapers has not been supplemented by an increase in revenue for digital advertising on newspaper websites or online newspapers. Although most newspapers in the world already have an online version, the majority struggle to run it profitably. The news industry is therefore still looking for a sustainable business model. Market structures are constantly changing due to market dynamics. The article indicates that in a fully competitive market, the industry’s demand and supply determine the prevailing market price, and with the concentrated media market in South Africa, several strategies can be followed to win market share. In essence, the South African media industry is oligopolistic in nature. The growing presence of complementary and substitute products in the media industry for printed newspapers has caused significant changes with the ecosystems in terms of the quantity demanded versus changes in demand. Newspaper publishers in the new fragmented media market need to make strategic decisions for sustained growth and improved operational efficiency. In response to the challenges of newspapers, several strategic considerations are proposed – a series of consolidations are already happening in the industry with larger media houses that aggressively acquired smaller competitors. Mergers and acquisitions can provide traction to newspapers and rationalize the number of major players in the industry. The above implies changing business models that are adaptable for strategic considerations to increase subscription and advertising income levels and revenue from other avenues. The strategic options aim to realize greater scale, increasing circulation and income stability. A sustained factor for the printed newspaper is the existing brand value created. Confidence will play a more important role in today’s news landscape with its escalating fake news. The research found that trends in the printed newspaper market have yielded confusing results over the last few years. It represents a world of increasing openness, media diversity and complex choices on both sides of the market. The newspaper industry in South Africa is still navigating through the many variables and hence there is no single optimizing business model. The successful transformation of the printing industry with news as commodity will be driven by relevant research data. The demand for newspapers as a whole is under pressure due to a growing consumer empowerment for other substitutes. Undoubtedly, the industry in South Africa will also increasingly integrate print and digital operations into a hybrid model with the continuous pursuit of critical mass in a multi-channel marketing landscape. For Afrikaans newspapers it implies that the business model going forward needs to be more diversified. The newspaper industry is increasingly becoming a scale business and the overall characteristic is therefore a consolidation phase that strives for optimal mixtures between the various media formats. There is still a viable demand for the printed Afrikaans newspaper, but creative innovation is required to make it sustainable. In the end, it is still market forces that will be the major determinant and, by implication, the Afrikaans reader who is going to drive the quantity demanded. © 2018 South African Academy for Science and the Arts.

Modeling the internet of things adoption barriers in food retail supply chains,Kamble S.S.; Gunasekaran A.; Parekh H.; Joshi S.,2019,10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.02.020,"Internet of things (IoT) is estimated to play a significant role in offering tangible and commercial benefits to the supply chains making the operational processes more efficient and productive. IoT system provides the decision-makers with new insights on the value proposition, value creation, helping them to strengthen their bond with the customers and adopt a more effective policy and practices. The food retailing scenario is becoming more complex and flexible putting pressure on the retailing firms to re-design their marketing strategies incorporating the changing consumer behavior. The IoT is expected to help the retailers in controlling the quality of food products, plan waste management of the items that have exceeded their shelf life, manage the temperature at the store, freezers and other equipment's contributing to the reduction of energy consumption. Despite the vast potential of IoT in food retail supply chains, the adoption of IoT is still in its nascent stage. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the various barriers that affect the adoption of IoT in the retail supply chain in the Indian context and also investigates the inter-dependences between the factors using a two-stage integrated ISM and DEMATEL methodology.

Utilization of green internet of things (GIoT) applications towards sustainable performance: The antecedents and consequences of carbon footprint,Alalwan A.A.; Baabdullah A.M.; Dwivedi Y.K.; Al-Sulaiti K.I.; Khoualdi K.; Albanna H.,2024,10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142956,"This study aims to propose and investigate the key factors that predict the Utilization of Green Internet of Things (U-GIoT) applications by business organizations. This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT. This study presents a valuable contribution that helps researchers; policy-makers, and practitioners to identify and understand the most important antecedents and consequences of U-GIoT.

Women as Industry 4.0. entrepreneurs: unlocking the potential of entrepreneurship in Higher Education in STEM-related fields,Serrano D.R.; Fraguas-Sánchez A.I.; González-Burgos E.; Martín P.; Llorente C.; Lalatsa A.,2023,10.1186/s13731-023-00346-4,"Industry 4.0 is the realization of digital transformation including enhanced productivity and flexibility due to real-time decision-making, which is possible due to the high-speed internet, the internet of things, and smart machines capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions, and controlling each other independently. A high level of education and skills is increasingly more important in the job market over the next years necessitating finding a balance among behavioural, technological, analytical, and entrepreneurial skills. EU and governments worldwide should invest in closing the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education as this will directly impact the economic growth. Even though there is some progress in the hiring percentage of women in large technological companies, a clear glass ceiling in leadership roles is still remains. Here, we have undertaken a pilot study at University Complutense of Madrid (UCM, Spain) aimed at empowering women in academia to transition from the “publish or perish” paradigm towards creating and protecting their intellectual property to close the gender gap in STEM fields and leadership roles as well as training to fuel the development of innovative start-ups addressing societal challenges. A total of 20 participants inclusive of UCM staff and postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers were enrolled after successfully obtaining at least a score of 5 out of 10 in custom-made Entrepreneurial competency test provided by Business and Professional Women Association (BPW, Spain) and theGrowBox Innovation Ltd. The study, approved by the UCM ethical committee, was conducted after participants engaged and completed a training programme on “Enterpreneurship in STEM-related fields in Higher Education” aimed to introduce the participants to the entrepreneurial world. This involved a structured training programme covering the (i) business canvas design; (ii) development of minimum viable product (MVP); (iii) market evaluation; (iv) finance analysis using the Growbox platform; (v) introduction to venture capital; and (vi) human resources management followed by individual mentoring sessions prior completion of their business plans that were pitched to a panel of mentors and BPW representatives. Finally, all participants completed an anonymous survey of 12 open questions to evaluate the impact of the training in awakening the entrepreneurial spirit in academic researchers in Higher Education in STEM-related fields. Three-quarters of participants were novices in terms of Entrepreneurship, but all participants after the programme presented a complete business plan. The three points that women identified as prohibitive factors were lack of self-confidence, ambition, and knowledge in the fields of patent filing, finance and marketing. Participants were likely to initiate their own start-up in the next five years, but had mixed fillings regarding the complexity of the process. Nine months after the course ended, four out of 20 participants have been successful in attracting initial funding to support the initiation of a start-up involving protected intellectual property and managed to secure an award to provide them with office space to build their company. The long-term impact of this training programme will need to be followed up.

Blending Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions into relationship marketing strategies,Lo F.-Y.; Campos N.,2018,10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.029,"With contemporary life becoming more instantly connected and as the disruptiveness of technologies is occurring at a faster pace, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is now even more accessible and common, prompting companies to adopt IoT solutions to improve their customers' experiences. IoT enables physical devices to connect and exchange data through the Internet by collecting strategic information, thus creating opportunities for companies to become more efficient and responsive to market changes. This paper thus investigates how companies are blending IoT solutions into their relationship marketing strategies and focuses on finding how this combination can boost business performance and what the challenges are when dealing with disruptive technology changes. To explore the subject's detailed information and to get a better understanding of managerial decisions concerning IoT, this research conducts in-depth case design analysis from a company's point of view. The data presented herein come from two main sources: open-ended interviews and direct observations, with the interviewees holding high managerial positions in Taiwan's IoT industry. This study aims to contribute to the literature by bringing awareness to the importance of closely following technological trends in combination with relationship marketing strategies and how they help firms remain competitive and profitable. The results of this empirical research shed light on the importance of understanding the impacts of IoT solutions on businesses, especially on clients' behaviors and the development of targeted strategies. The cases herein present similarities on the awareness of the speed of disruptive technologies like IoT, the importance of developing new solutions aligned with new technologies, their impact at creating new business solutions, and their contribution to the development of firm strategies. The findings also show that the application of innovative IoT solutions positively affects the process of developing long and successful relationships through relationship marketing actions. Conversely, concerns related to data security vary according to business segments and relationship marketing pillars such as trust, commitment, and reliability, which could help reduce feelings of ambiguity. This research contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a deeper understanding of the correlation between IoT and relationship marketing. Moreover, we illustrate how a combination of these two factors can contribute to the development of stronger marketing strategies, as well as their implications on business.

"MSME Clusterization Using K-Means Clustering in Garut Regency, Indonesia",Alamanda D.T.; Kusmiati E.; Shiddieq D.F.; Roji F.F.,2022,,"Clusters are groups of activities consisting of core industries, related industries, supporting industries, and supporting and related economic activities, which are interrelated and mutually supportive. This study aims to cluster micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Garut Regency based on their similarity of attributes attached to the factors. These aspects include a taxpayer identification ownership, business license ownership, total net worth, total capital, number of employees, total business volume, product certification, product license, and brand. Clusterization has an important urgency for the development of MSMEs. Clustering can help group MSMEs into groups that are easier to analyze and make the right decisions to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of MSMEs. In addition, the application of clustering for MSMEs can have positive implications such as identifying the characteristics of MSMEs, developing appropriate marketing strategies, improving product or service quality, collaboration and information exchange, and access to resources. This can help MSMEs to increase their efficiency and competitiveness in the market.

A Hybrid Model for China’s Soybean Spot Price Prediction by Integrating CEEMDAN with Fuzzy Entropy Clustering and CNN-GRU-Attention,Liu D.; Tang Z.; Cai Y.,2022,10.3390/su142315522,"China’s soybean spot price has historically been highly volatile due to the combined effects of long-term massive import dependence and intricate policies, as well as inherent environmental elements. The accurate prediction of the price is crucial for reducing the amount of soybean-linked risks worldwide and valuable for the long-term sustainability of global agriculture. Therefore, a hybrid prediction model that combines component clustering and a neural network with an attention mechanism has been developed. After fully integrated complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) processing of the price series, the fuzzy entropy of each component is measured as the complexity characteristic. K-means clustering and reconstruction are applied to the components before being input to the CNN-GRU-Attention network for prediction to improve the model ability and adaptability of the sequences. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model outperforms other decomposition techniques and machine learning algorithms regarding prediction accuracy.

Customers of place: Exploring interregional migrant collectivities,Kadirov D.; Triveni A.,2010,10.1108/17538331011083916,"Purpose – The aim of this research is to explore how and why different migrant groups see different values in places they move to. Understanding these values and also the conditions in which these values are shaped will help in targeting marketing effort. Design/methodology/approach – The hierarchical and K/means cluster analyses were instrumental in identifying different migrant clusters. Planned contrasts were employed to compare related pairs of clusters. The logistic regression analysis identified several determinants of cluster membership likelihood. Findings – Four different internal migrant clusters are identified in the Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand. These are Material Success Seekers, Community/Environment Folks, Apathetics, and All/rounders. The former two express a fragmentalist lifestyle. Material Success Seekers emphasise regional business opportunities while being indifferent to social and natural resources. In contrast, Community/Environment Folks emphasise social and natural resources while maintaining indifference to business opportunities. In turn, the latter two clusters make up a holistic lifestyle: All/rounders consider all three major characteristics of the region to be important while apathetics totally deemphasise these characteristics. The planned contrasts show that demographics are instrumental in predicting differences between related clusters but not helpful in distinguishing the identified lifestyles. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this investigation is that the important constructs used to cluster migrants are not well calibrated, although the reliability scores appear to be satisfactory. Moreover, the use of four/point importance scales does not allow attaining a greater level of construct sensitivity. The research method is unique in a sense that the cluster analysis and the planned contrasts are applied to examine contrasting values of migrant collectivities. Practical implications – A number of specific practical challenges need to be resolved by the regional decision makers in order to enhance place satisfaction by internal migrant collectivities. First, the regional and city councils will need to tailor different services, facilities, and public spaces to appeal to different requirements of migrant clusters. Second, the region's settlement support agency should provide migrants with relevant, focused, and differentiated information about available services and resources to suit their various life goals, aspirations, and values. Originality/value – This investigation tackles the problem of lacking theoretical and empirical research foundation on internal migration as a marketing phenomenon. Moreover, it is unique in its approach of conceptualising migrant segments as cultural phenomena, that is, interdependent collectivities that form on the basis of contrasting values. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Cluster analysis; Immigration; Lifestyles; Market segmentation; Marketing; New Zealand,,scopus-k-means,Tactical,"The research identifies specific migrant clusters and their values, which can inform targeted marketing efforts and service provision.

Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) Environments: Market Segments and Risk,Rockloff M.; Moskovsky N.; Thorne H.; Browne M.; Bryden G.,2017,10.1007/s10899-017-9681-7,"This study used a marketing-research paradigm to explore gamblers’ attraction to EGMs based on different elements of the environment. A select set of environmental features was sourced from a prior study (Thorne et al. in J Gambl Issues 2016b), and a discrete choice experiment was conducted through an online survey. Using the same dataset first described by Rockloff et al. (EGM Environments that contribute to excess consumption and harm, 2015), a sample of 245 EGM gamblers were sourced from clubs in Victoria, Australia, and 7516 gamblers from an Australian national online survey-panel. Participants’ choices amongst sets of hypothetical gambling environments allowed for an estimation of the implied individual-level utilities for each feature (e.g., general sounds, location, etc.). K-means clustering on these utilities identified four unique market segments for EGM gambling, representing four different types of consumers. The segments were named according to their dominant features: Social, Value, High Roller and Internet. We found that the environments orientated towards the Social and Value segments were most conducive to attracting players with relatively few gambling problems, while the High Roller and Internet-focused environments had greater appeal for players with problems and vulnerabilities.

Two-stage geomarketing WebGIS solution for a retail location problem; [Webgis de geomarketing: SoluÇÃo de dois estÁgios para um problema de localizaÇÃo do varejo],Salgado R.R.; Libório M.P.; Da Silva Martin C.A.P.; Bernardes P.,2019,10.5380/raega.v46i1.56067,"Market decisions are complex because they involve many data and related criteria in geographic space with different intensities. Geographic information systems (GIS) provide solutions that allow the understanding and understanding of market problems (Geomarketing) and help the decision-making process by allowing the treatment and geographical analysis of these data and criteria. However, GIS involves resources such as people, equipment and maintenance which are not always available. Web-based GIS (WebGIS) can offer the same GIS solutions but require less resources. However, studies show that WebGIS has not been used to its full potential, limited to the geovisualization of points of interest. We propose a Geomarketing WebGIS to solve a classic problem of geographic-market decision. Operated by a two-stage method and spatial analysis (k-means, Voronoi diagram, weighted midpoint, and kernel density function), Geomarketing WebGIS uses potential customer data to show a set of store-branches and the parent-store location. Through simulation, we show that the Geomarketing WebGIS can go beyond the geovisualization and offer solution to a relevant problem of the literature without the restrictions found in the GIS. These findings help to reaffirm that WebGIS: i) has the potential to solve complex geographic problems; ii) have features and resources such as GIS but maintained and operated with fewer resources; and iii) favor the geographic thinking. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Does diversity facilitate consumer decisions: a comparative perspective based on single-category versus multi-category products,Dong X.; Tu H.; Zhu H.; Liu T.; Zhao X.; Xie K.,2024,10.1108/APJML-05-2023-0395,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the opposite effects of single-category versus multi-category products information diversity on consumer decision making. Further, the authors investigate the moderating role of three categories of visitors – direct, hesitant and hedonic – in the relationship between product information diversity and consumer decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The research utilizes a sample of 1,101,062 product click streams from 4,200 consumers. Visitors are clustered using the k-means algorithm. The diversity of information recommendations for single and multi-category products is characterized using granularity and dispersion, respectively. Empirical analysis is conducted to examine their influence on the two-stage decision-making process of heterogeneous online visitors. Findings: The study reveals that the impact of recommended information diversity on consumer decision making differs significantly between single-category and multiple-category products. Specifically, information diversity in single-category products enhances consumers' click and purchase intention, while information diversity in multiple-category products reduces consumers' click and purchase intention. Moreover, based on the analysis of online visiting heterogeneity, hesitant, direct and hedonic features enhance the positive impact of granularity on consumer decision making; while direct features exacerbate the negative impact of dispersion on consumer decision making.

Analysis of asymmetry factors in the development of the EU tourism industry,Polyakov M.; Bilozubenko V.; Nebaba N.; Korneyev M.; Saihak Y.,2020,10.21511/im.16(4).2020.10,"The effects of the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis call for more active support for the tourism industry. To pursue a supranational tourism policy and create a favorable marketing environment at the national level, it is necessary to consider the objective differences between member states and their characteristics in the field of tourism. This study aims to highlight the main factors that characterize the asymmetry of the tourism industry in the EU countries, which allows ensuring the competitiveness of national tourism companies through the formation of an appropriate marketing strategy. The research methodology includes calculation of the asymmetry coefficient and cluster and classification analysis based on Eurostat data. At the first stage, 27 indicators were selected that characterize the structural proportions of the tourism industry and the intensity of tourism in the EU countries. Based on the calculation of the asymmetry coefficient, a high level of heterogeneity of the tourism industry parameters in the EU countries for each of the indicators was demonstrated. At the second stage, clustering (algorithm - k-means, metric - Euclidean distance) of the EU countries was carried out according to the selected indicators. As a result, eight clusters were obtained, which showed asymmetry in developing national tourism sectors in the EU. At the third stage, as a result of classification (method - decision trees), seven combinations of indicators were identified, which completely distinguish the resulting clusters of the EU countries. The parameters included in these combinations are, in fact, the main factors of the asymmetry in the development of the EU tourism industry. Based on the analysis of the asymmetric development of the tourism industry by country, it is possible to determine its growth points and competitiveness drivers in the EU internal market and identify marketing strategies. © This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",Asymmetry factors; Country clustering; Marketing strategy; Supranational policy; Tourism,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,scopus-k-means,Strategic,"The abstract discusses long-term objectives for the tourism industry, including the formation of marketing strategies and identifying competitiveness drivers across EU countries, which aligns with strategic planning.",70,20,5,0,5
A driving behavior distribution fitting method based on two-stage hybrid user classification,Su H.; Zhang Q.; Wang W.; Tang X.,2021,10.3390/su13137018,"Determining the distribution fitting of traditional private vehicle user driving behavior is an effective way to understand the differences between different users and provides valuable information on user travel demands. The classification of users is significant to product improvement, precision marketing, and driving recommendations. This study proposed a method which includes four aspects: (1) data collection; (2) data preprocessing; (3) data analysis—a two-stage hybrid user classification, and (4) distribution fitting method. A two-stage hybrid user classification method is used to cluster traditional vehicle users. First, the first-stage classification of the classification method extracts the daily typical time–mileage-series travel patterns (TMTP) to obtain user driving time characteristics. This first-stage classification also extracts the mean and standard deviation of the daily vehicle mileage traveled (DVMT) to express user driving demands. Next, users are divided by K-means based on the driving time characteristics and driving demands from the first stage. Finally, a three-parameter log-normal distribution is used to fit the DVMT of different user types. Comparison with traditional clustering based on the mean and standard deviation and the proportion of each vehicle’s time series in the TMTP types, this study reveals that the new methods provide significant advantages in analyzing driving behavior and high reference value for enterprises making electric vehicle driving range recommendations, car market segmentation, and policy making decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

Mass customization strategy development by FIRM,Pishdad A.; Taghiyareh F.,2011,10.1057/dbm.2011.37,"Purpose- Nowadays, managers achieve superior performance and greater efficiency by evaluating their firm's readiness for mass customization before committing their company to such a strategy. The purpose of this article is to handle this issue by proposing a managerial framework- named FIRM- for firm profiling, which offers the strategic shift toward mass customization concept. The aim is to provide a tool for executives, which helps them discuss strengths and weaknesses in the internal production and information technology areas before utilizing these policies. Design/methodology/approach- The research procedure consists of measurement scales generation, data gathering, purification phase, firm clustering and profiling.

Assessing hotel readiness to offer local cuisines: a clustering approach,Bondzi-Simpson A.; Ayeh J.K.,2019,10.1108/IJCHM-12-2017-0820,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the organisational readiness of small and medium scaled hotels to serve indigenous local cuisines and to segment the hotel properties for gastronomic tourism campaigning and destination marketing aims. The study also explores how the concept of organisational readiness relates to menu decision makers’ intentions, perceived benefits and organisational characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Organisational readiness was measured by three dimensions (culture, climate and capacity). Data were derived from a survey of primary menu decision makers from 187 hotels in Ghana. Using a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical (K-means) algorithms, the hotels were clustered into homogenous groups based on the original raw scores of hotel readiness indicators. The resultant cluster solution was then validated and profiled against relevant external variables. Findings: Analyses reveal three clusters which distinguish hotels by the degree of readiness to serve indigenous local dishes. The resultant segments differ by hotel category (star rating) as well as by the job positions and perceptions of primary menu decision makers. Unexpectedly, lower class hotels displayed significantly greater levels of organisational readiness to serve indigenous cuisines than those in the higher class category. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates that organisational readiness is related to perceived benefits and intentions. Among others, the findings advance the understanding of organisational readiness in hotels in the context of menu decision-making. Given the need to embed new practices in a fast-changing hospitality environment, insights drawn could also serve as a basis for future research. Generalisability of empirical findings may be limited by the socio-economic context as well as the study’s focus on small and medium scaled hotels. Practical implications: This paper supports hotel businesses in understanding the concept of organisational readiness and its relation to organisational characteristics and menu decision-making. By highlighting the different clusters of hotels, the findings accentuate the need for destination marketers and gastronomic tourism campaigners to target higher classed hotels and draw attention to the potential benefits of serving indigenous cuisines while addressing latent concerns. The results further underscore the role of organisational culture and the necessity for such campaign activities to be directed towards those with ample influence within the hierarchical structures of hotels. Originality/value: This is an initial attempt to examine the application of the organisational readiness concept to menu decision-making in hotels and to explore the implications for segmentation purposes. Further analysis revealed the critical role of organisational culture on menu decision-making patterns. Thus, the paper applies an important element of organisational development theory to the hotel industry and represents a valuable contribution to the scant literature on indigenous cuisines in hotel food service contexts. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Culinary tourism; Food service; Indigenous dishes; Menus; Organizational readiness; Segmentation,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,scopus-k-means,Tactical,"The abstract discusses the assessment of organizational readiness of hotels to serve indigenous cuisines, which translates strategic goals into actionable insights for marketing and campaign targeting.

Determining Turkish consumers’ consumption satisfaction with Erzurum Civil cheese,Uzundumlu A.S.; Topcu Y.,2016,10.1108/BFJ-03-2015-0113,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to determine redesigned product profiles to maximize Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction of Turkish consumers under an ordinal utility approach. Design/methodology/approach – Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Erzurum in 2014. A conjoint analysis was used to determine the utilities of each level along with the relative importance of Erzurum Civil cheese attributes for measuring the consumption satisfaction as an indicator of the purchase decision and priorities of Turkish consumers. Findings – The results of the study clearly highlighted that Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction was maximized with the augmented and actual product images redesigned by a private-labelled and local-branded simple product with the highest and medium prices based on organic production techniques for heavy and light consumers, respectively. However, medium consumers appreciated the core benefit obtained from the credence quality attributes supported by the generic branded simple cheese with the lowest price purchased directly from the farmstead villages. Eventually, these marketing tactics and strategies could increase demand, maximizing the cheese consumption and satisfaction of Turkish consumers in each cluster. They could also provide greater consumption satisfaction to Turkish consumers as well as bigger marginal contributions to the market dynamics of the food supply chain. Originality/value – This study was the first research conducted on Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction of Turkish consumers using innovative approaches and brand designations, such as Protected Designation of Origin, Protected Geographical Indication, and Traditional Specialty Guaranteed in Turkey using the conjoint and k-mean cluster analyses techniques. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Conjoint analysis; Erzurum Civil cheese; Fractional factorial design; Relative importance; Turkish consumer satisfaction,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,scopus-k-means,Tactical,"The study focuses on optimizing product profiles and marketing strategies based on consumer preferences, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

Marketing Strategy Selection for Small-Scale Fruit and Vegetable Growers: Lessons from the Mid-Southern United States,Popp M.; Mahamba G.; Thompson J.; Malone T.; Popp J.,2023,,"This study uses primary data analysis to investigate market outlet choices of small-scale fruit and vegetable growers in the Mid-South region. Factors such as distance to market, marketing costs, sales volume, and production methods significantly influence growers’ decisions. Policy implications include the need for industry-specific guidelines and networking opportunities for wholesalers, streamlined regulatory processes, support for local sourcing by restaurants, and support for educational efforts. Overall, this study sheds light on the market outlet choices of small-scale fruit and vegetable growers, offering guidance for policy makers to foster the success of these growers in the Mid-South and beyond. © 2023, Food Distribution Research Society.

Information and source preferences of a student market in higher education,Bonnema J.; Van Der Waldt D.L.R.,2008,10.1108/09513540810875653,"Purpose - Marketing communication practitioners in higher education have not yet identified specific subgroups with similar characteristics within the prospective student (target) market, and do not always know which preferred sources learners consult when deciding on a tertiary institution for further or higher education. In addition, little is known about prospective students' information needs when deciding which institution to attend. As a result many tertiary institutions still use one message in one medium for all target markets. The aims of this paper are: to determine if sub-groups exist within the student recruitment market that need tailor made persuasive messages; to determine the preferred sources of information gathering for prospective students that influences their choice of tertiary institution; and to determine the information needs of prospective students that influence their decisions to select an institution of higher education. Design/methodology/approach - A stratified random sample of 19 schools was drawn, from which a total of 716 successfully completed questionnaires were used to conduct factor and cluster analyses to determine information needs and source preferences of these respondents. Findings - Ten factors under the VARCLUS procedure with high eigen values were grouped together with the following labels: university, college, employability aspects, course content, student experience, sporting aspects, financial aspects, direct sources, media sources and social sources. Five sub-groups clustered together with the K-means analysis, labelled: have lots, aspiring have lots, little direction and new lifers. Research limitations/implications - A limited amount of literature is available on the current use of media and sources by the target market. Decisions on the choice of a tertiary institution for higher education are most probably influenced by socio-economic circumstances in a developing context, like South Africa. Practical implications - An integrated and well co-ordinated media and message strategy for each of the various sub-groups should be specified for an IMC plan to be successful. Originality/value - This is one of the few research articles on media and source preferences of potential students in the Cape Metropolitan. The cluster analysis revealed five clusters of sub-groups that have specific media and source needs to make the decision on furthering studies at tertiary level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; Higher education; Information media; Recruitment; South Africa; Students,,scopus-k-means,Tactical,"The abstract discusses determining preferred sources of information and the specific sub-groups within the prospective student market.

Segmenting and Profiling the Chocolate Consumer: An Emerging Market Perspective,Sondhi N.; Chawla D.,2017,10.1080/10454446.2017.1244784,"Psychographic segmentation has found higher merit among marketing scholars and practicing managers in designing effective marketing strategies to target and deliver better—especially for indulgence food such as chocolates. Hence, adopting a mixed method approach, 17 attitudinal statements were generated through focus group discussions and were used to segment a sample of 301 urban chocolate consumers. The survey data was subjected to a K-means cluster analysis, and it revealed the existence of three distinct clusters: the innovative national; the conservative patriot; and the global seeker. Chi-square analysis was conducted to profile the three groups. Though the study was exploratory in nature, the clusters exhibited such distinct buying patterns that the results hold tremendous value not only from an academic perspective but also for chocolate manufacturers and retailers. All three groups were buying chocolates for gifting purpose, while the young innovators liked to buy for self-gifts as well. Point of sales display had maximum impact on their purchase decision. The global seeker was buying more foreign brands versus the other two, who bought chocolate brands of national origin. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",adult consumers; Chocolate consumption; cluster analysis; emerging markets; Segmentation,Routledge,scopus-k-means,Tactical,"The abstract discusses psychographic segmentation and the analysis of consumer behavior related to chocolate purchasing, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.
