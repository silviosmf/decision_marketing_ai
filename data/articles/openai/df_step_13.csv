"Tourism plays an important role not only in the economic life of the developing countries, but also in the structure of economies of the industrially developed states. Tourism carries out not only economic, but the social functions. The purpose of this research is to study the German experience, development and promotion of the tourism sector at the national and international tourist markets. The method of the system analysis, the content analysis of the scientific literature, the economical and the statistical methods, the com-parative method, the method of the expert evaluations, the analytical methods of a research were used. Some benefits were identified, as a result of the conducted research, which can be received due to the tourism de-velopment by private business and territories. The author gives his practical recommendations for tourist stakeholders in the Russian regions. The novelty of the research consists in the creative rethinking of the ste-reotypical approaches to the development of the regional tourism in the Russian Federation. Conclusions and recommendations can be used in practical activities of the state for management decisions in tourism industry of Russia.",Volkov S.K.,Strategic,10.15211/soveurope52016109117,Destination marketing; Marketing in tourism; Regional development; Tourism; Tourism organizations; Tourism policy,5.0,,10,5,Institute of Europe Russian Academy of Sciences,"The abstract focuses on the long-term implications and strategies for the development and promotion of the tourism sector, particularly in the context of the German experience and its applicability to Russia.

"Many manufacturers are today striving to offer a large number of value-added PSSs (Product-Service Systems). The increased number of PSS hinders potential buyers from effectively discovering the most suitable PSS to satisfy their personalized requirements. To accurately find the needed or wanted PSS with lower search costs, it is effective to recommend suitable PSS solutions to the right buyers. However, service, a component of PSS, brings more subjective and imprecise information in acquiring users' preferences due to e.g. their different experience and knowledge on services. Moreover, the interactions within user's preferences are often omitted in previous methods, which may lead to inaccurate recommendation results. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative method for PSS recommendation is developed. This method explicitly takes into account the environmental aspect of PSSs in question so that a method user can be guided to select an environmentally superior alternative. In addition, rough DEMATEL (Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) is proposed to manipulate the interactions of vague user preferences in multi-criteria weight determination. Furthermore, a rough collaborative filtering approach is developed to make PSS recommendation under vague environment. A case study of elevator PSS recommendation shows the feasibility and potentials of the proposed approach. Theoretically, the new method can produce more reasonable PSS recommendation results by considering the interdependencies between different recommendation criteria. In marketing practice, the method can suggest proposals of new offerings to customers in a proactive manner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Song W.; Sakao T.,Operational,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.092,DEMATEL; Personalization; Product-Service System; Recommendation; Search cost,5.0,,60,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a method for recommending Product-Service Systems (PSS) to users based on their preferences, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer decisions and recommendations online.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,An environmentally conscious PSS recommendation method based on users' vague ratings: A rough multi-criteria approach,2018
"Considering the benefits of the organic production system, it is recognized as one of the main drivers of future economic development. However, the imbalance between demand and supply at the local market level represents one of the serious obstacles that prevents its future growth. Therefore, this article examines the key factors related to the main elements of the offer that have the strongest impact on consumer preferences and acceptance of organic food products. In that sense, organic product, price, distribution channel, and promotion are considered the main elements of the offer and are analyzed in this paper from the consumer preferences perspective. Further, this article provides insight into some of the sensory properties of the offer that are important to consumers. Finally, it gives recommendations for optimization of the offer on the organic food market based on the analysis of the influence of each of those elements (product, price, distribution, and promotion) on consumer acceptance of organic products and making purchasing decisions. The data were collected using a questionnaire, and analyzed using the structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that price and promotion have the strongest impact on consumer acceptance and buying decisions. Further analysis revealed that attitudes towards organic food products, price/quality ratio, distribution barriers, and modern media as a promotion instrument are the factors that have the most significant impact on consumer perception and attitudes towards the available market offer. These findings can help producers and other decision makers to better understand what creates added value of the organic food products in consumers’ mind and therefore make an offer that is in line with their expectations and preferences, which is recognized as one of the main prerequisites for the acceptance and purchase of organic food products. © 2020 by the authors.",Melovic B.; Cirovic D.; Dudic B.; Vulic T.B.; Gregus M.,Tactical,10.3390/foods9030259,Consumer preferences; Market; Optimization; Organic food; Product acceptance; Sensory properties,5.0,,15,0,MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,"The abstract focuses on analyzing consumer preferences and acceptance of organic food products, which involves structured decisions related to marketing elements such as product, price, distribution, and promotion, making it more aligned with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The analysis of marketing factors influencing consumers’ preferences and acceptance of organic food products—recommendations for the optimization of the offer in a developing market,2020
"Devolution in forestry generally refers to the transfer of some degree of central government authority to local responsibility. It commonly takes the form of recommendations by external advisors in developing country situations who encourage formally organized decision making by a local political community. This paper reviews the literature on local tenure, the summaries of case studies in forestry, and the broader history of experience with collectives and cooperatives with the objective of identifying the characteristic cases where some form of collective or community forest management might be successful. The paper identifies four cases. It concludes that, at some level, smaller groups of managers may cooperate in labor and capital intensive activities like fire control or harvesting, or in specialized activities beyond their personal expertise, activities like processing and marketing their products. Successful and sustainable community-wide collective enterprises seldom include agricultural or forest land—with the possible, and likely impermanent, exception of low-valued open access land beyond the perimeter of agricultural crops and managed forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Hyde W.F.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.forpol.2016.06.018,Collective action; Community forestry; Devolution,0.0,,0,100,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract discusses devolution in forestry and community management, which is not related to marketing or the examples provided in the classification levels.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Whereabouts devolution and collective forest management?,2016
"Purpose: The number of studies on the use of choice cues in the purchase decision of a smartphone does not appear to be extensive, given the size and rate of growth of the market. Surprisingly, it appears that no study of this type in the Chinese context has been undertaken. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the existing gap in the marketing literature in this area. Design/methodology/approach: Best–Worst (BW) scaling method was used in the study. It is suggested that the method overcomes some of the biases commonly found in surveys where Likert-type scales are used, and it has superior discriminating power, because respondents are asked to rank the most and the least important factor from a group, and are thereby forced to make tradeoffs between factors. Findings: Among the 13 choice cues, connectivity, price and memory capacity are found to be the most important, whereas recommendation from others, ease of handling and availability of apps are found to be the least important. Findings due to gender, income and age difference were also analyzed and discussed for orderly decision-making purposes. Practical implications: The ranking of factors showing what choice cues consumers consider most or least important in a particular market helps practitioners to develop appropriate adaptation strategies for the market. The comparison of findings for gender, income and age difference can further help practitioners to devise various alternative marketing strategies for different market segments and identify underserved segments, if any. Originality/value: The BW scaling method, however, appropriate in ranking order of importance, had never been used in ranking choice cues of smartphone purchase. Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of studies about ranking of choice cues on smartphone purchases in the Chinese context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Pinto L.; Kaynak E.; Chow C.S.F.; Zhang L.L.,Tactical,10.1108/APJML-01-2018-0004,Best–Worst scaling method; Buying decision process; Chinese context; Product attributes; Ranking of importance; Smartphone,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The study focuses on identifying and ranking choice cues that influence smartphone purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical marketing strategies aimed at segmenting markets and optimizing product offerings based on consumer preferences.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Ranking of choice cues for smartphones using the Best–Worst scaling method,2019
"Purpose: As organisations are increasing their investment in social media marketing (SMM), evaluation of such techniques is becoming increasingly important. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge regarding SMM strategy by developing a stage model of SMM evaluation and uncovering the challenges in this process. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with 18 key informants working for specialist SMM agencies. Such informants are a particularly rich source, since they manage social media campaigns for a wide range of clients. An exploratory research was conducted and thematic analysis surfaced the key components of the SMM evaluation process and associated challenges. Findings: The SMM evaluation framework is developed. This framework has the following six stages: setting evaluation objectives, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying metrics, data collection and analysis, report generation and management decision making. Challenges associated with each stage of the framework are identified, and discussed with a view to better understanding decision making associated with social media strategies. Two key challenges are the agency-client relationship and the available social analytics tools. Originality/value: Despite an increasing body of research on social media objectives, KPIs and metrics, no previous study has explored how these components are embedded in a marketing campaign planning process. The paper also offers insights in the factors that make SMM evaluation complex and challenging. Recommendations for further research and practice are offered. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Keegan B.J.; Rowley J.,Tactical,10.1108/MD-10-2015-0450,Agency-client relationship; Digital marketing; Social media analytics; Social media marketing; Social media marketing evaluation,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract focuses on developing a stage model for evaluating social media marketing strategies, which interprets strategic goals into structured targets that can be implemented in marketing campaigns.

"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how students in a Malaysian context, as a result of their experience of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) undergraduate teaching and learning experience in the subject of Marketing, perceive the knowledge, skills and competencies required of a practicing marketer and, conversely, what curriculum developers need to do if there is a ""shortfall"". Design/methodology/approach: Based on a total sample of a UG student population from an Accountancy, Finance and Business Faculty, the primarily descriptive, positivist, cross-sectional study used inferential statistics to measure the relationship between the four components of marketing knowledge, skills and competencies (the marketing mix, performance, social and emotional competencies, and responsible decision making). Findings: Quantitative results revealed that all student perceptions of the requirements to be a ""fit for purpose"" marketer were highly correlated with requirements from the literature, subject benchmarks and practice with few exemptions. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on one institution. Moreover, knowledge, skills and competency requirements by students' level of study and practitioner experience may vary by type of HEI, organisation and geographic location. Practical implications: Recommendations are made for curriculum development to address both employability and career development, particularly in terms of interdisciplinary co-operation and the teaching and learning of concepts. Originality/value: Using the student perceptions of the requirements for being a practicing marketer, HEIs can adjust/add to their curriculum by comparing these to documented sources from academia and practice and by making any necessary adjustments by course of study. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Carter S.; Yeo A.C.-M.,Tactical,10.1108/HESWBL-12-2016-0084,Employability; Malaysia; Marketing knowledge; Skills and competencies; Student perceptions,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The study focuses on the curriculum development for marketing education based on student perceptions, which aligns with tactical decision-making aimed at improving specific programs and teaching methods.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,"Undergraduate perceptions of the knowledge, skills and competencies required of today's practicing marketer",2017
"Objective: Conflicts of interests resulting from interactions with pharmaceutical companies are pervasive in medicine and can result in an undue influence on physicians’ decision-making. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze published and scientifically evaluated curricula for medical students and residents regarding such conflicts of interest. We begin by describing the covered topics and teaching methods; afterwards we analyze the quality of the curricula using the published data on their evaluations and comparing the content with content recommended for such curricula. Methods: We searched Pubmed, Psyclnfo, EMBASE, OECD, WISO, SOWI and googlescholar up to and including the 5th of September 2016. Publications describing curricula for residents or medical students on the topic of conflicts of interest in medicine and evaluating them for their effects on the participants’ learning were included. We analyzed the covered topics and the teaching methods used and compared them with recommendations by the American Medical Students’ Association (AMSA) and Health Action International (HAI). Results: The literature search resulted in 20 publications that fulfilled our search criteria. In five trials, a control group was used, in no trial the participants were randomized to intervention or control group. 16/20 published curricula primarily covered marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies, especially the interaction with pharmaceutical sales representatives (PSRs). Most curricula only covered a limited number of topics recommended by AMSA/HAI. The most frequent teaching method was a group discussion, which was used in 18/20 curricula; all curricula used at least one interactive teaching method. The evaluation of the curricula was heterogeneous in results as well as design. Some publications described a change of attitudes toward a stronger skepticism regarding interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Four publications described improved knowledge, one publication described a change in behavior toward a reduction of the acceptance of gifts. Conclusion: The trials conducted to this date regarding curricula on conflicts of interests are methodologically flawed and the described curricula lack important topics beyond marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are no data so far on the sustainability of the courses’ effects on participants* behavior. It is therefore necessary to develop a model curriculum that covers a broader variety of topics and to evaluate it using a well thought-out methodology to create a foundation for the further improvement of teaching conflicts of interest in medicine. © 2017 Weißkircher et al.",Weißkircher J.; Koch C.; Dreimüller N.; Lieb K.,Out of scope,10.3205/zma001114,Advertising as topic; Conflict of interest; Curriculum; Drug industry; Medical education; Medical/psychology students,,0.0,0,100,Gesellschaft fur Medizinische Ausbildung,"The abstract discusses conflicts of interest in medical education regarding pharmaceutical companies, which is not related to marketing in the context specified.

"Recently, most companies interact more with their customers through the social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter. This has made large amount of textual data freely available on the internet for competitive intelligence analysis, which is helping reposition more and more companies for better profit. In order to carry out competitive intelligence, financial institutions need to take note of and analyse their competitor's social media sites. This paper, therefore, aims to help the banking industry in Nigeria understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge, which will form the foundation for decision-making and internet marketing of such institutions. The study describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyse unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the five largest and leading financial institutions (banks) in Nigeria: Zenith Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, Access Bank and GTBank. Analysing the social media content of these institutions will increase their competitive advantage and also lead to more profit for the banking institutions in question. The results obtained from this research showed that text mining is able to reveal uncommon and non-Trivial trend for competitive advantage from social media data, and also provide specific recommendations to help banks maximise their competitive edge. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Afolabi I.T.; Ezenwoke A.A.; Ayo C.K.,Tactical,10.1504/IJIMA.2017.085644,Banking; Clustering; Competitive intelligence; Facebook; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Text mining; Twitter,5.0,,10,5,Inderscience Publishers,"The abstract discusses the application of text mining for competitive analysis in the banking sector, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into specific actions related to user engagement and marketing analytics.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,Competitive analysis of social media data in the banking industry,2017
"Purpose – Social media continues to be the major influencer in the lives of the millennial and generation-z in many regions of the world; especially in influencing their travel decisions. In order to validate such relationship, a systematic literature review with an end goal of closing the current gaps in knowledge with regard to the impact of social media on tourism in the Asia-Pacific region has been conducted. Design/Methodology – We performed a systematic search of relevant literature through various databases including Scopus, ScienceDirect and ProQuest. In total, 25 articles were taken into consideration in which the review protocol made use of specific techniques such as PRISMA. Approach – We conceptualized the differences and similarities in the Asia-Pacific tourism industry influenced by social media. Findings – As a contribution to knowledge and practice, we found that the usage of social media for tourism marketing purposes is strongly correlated to the tourism industry in many countries of the APAC region. However, it has not yet been generalized as a popular tool in other nations in the region. Originality of the research – This study provides practical and future recommendations concerning the influence of social media in the Asia-Pacific context that has become increasingly popular. Asia-Pacific governments need to introduce social media inclusive tourism marketing to capture the full potential of their tourism industry. © 2020 University of Rijeka.

"The purpose of this research involves understanding individual motivations for volunteering in clinical trials and/or health-related product tests. Identifying the reasons leading to participation in clinical studies also ensures researchers are in a position to outline projects that benefit patients as well as predicting eventual barriers that might otherwise constrain their involvement. In this context, the paper seeks to reinforce the importance of marketing strategies for recruiting and retaining volunteers as well as gasping the most effective kind of approach (promotional, communicational, economic incentives, among others). This study is based on exploratory research, deploying a deductive method, bailing up statistical methods in order to identify the motivations influencing volunteers over healthcare related product test participation. The results reveal that participants attach high importance to health professional recommendations within the scope of their motivations for participating in clinical trials. The motivations related to logistical factors (such as time and location) prove relevant to helping in the process of clinical trial participation decision making as well as deciding on the preferred alternative incentives (discount coupons, vouchers, etc.). Participants consider that information provided in hospitals, clinics, and health centers encourages interest in clinical trial participation taking into account that these are studies in the health area and the information provided by these institutions, therefore, probably receives correspondingly greater credibility. © 2015 The Author(s).",Paco A.; Ferreira M.; Leal J.,Out of scope,10.1177/1745790416650602,Clinical trials; Communication strategies; Health-related product testing; Marketing strategies; Motivations,,0.0,0,100,SAGE Publications Ltd,"The abstract focuses on motivations for volunteering in clinical trials and health-related product tests, which are related to healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Motivations for participating in clinical trials and health-related product testing,2015
"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the dilemma that is based on a decision to disclose or not to disclose social shopping rewards (SSRs), in an effort to enhance the effectiveness of social shopping. To protect consumers and guide marketers, emergent forms of online commerce on social media platforms warrant closer examination. One such form is social shopping, which combines social media and online shopping. To motivate word of mouth (WOM) through social signs of approval or endorsement of brands, marketers have typically relied on social shopping rewards (SSRs). It is not typical, however, for the reason behind the social endorsement to be disclosed, leaving the branded message open to multiple interpretations. Design/methodology/approach – The dilemma of SSR disclosures is presented in a marketing and public policy analysis, drawing from findings from theWOMliterature on disclosure, incentives, source credibility and on social media Disclosure Guidelines by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA). Based on this analysis and on an extension of the Dual Credibility Model, a conceptual model is proposed that shows how disclosure works through source credibility to produce positive social shopping outcomes. Findings – In addition to the conceptual model, recommendations are made for marketing research, practice and public policy. Of significance are proposed SSR Disclosure Guidelines that extend FTC and WOMMA guidelines for best practices in disclosures in social media. Originality/value – This paper represents pioneering research on the disclosure of SSRs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Coker K.K.; Smith D.S.; Altobello S.A.,Strategic,10.1108/JRIM-06-2014-0030,Marketing communications; Marketing ethics; Online consumer behavior; Retailing online; Social media marketing; Word-of-mouth marketing,10.0,,10,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the implications of disclosing social shopping rewards (SSRs) on consumer behavior and marketing effectiveness.

"Case Description: The primary subject matter of this case concerns the pricing decision of a service firm, and the use of the appropriate economic model to analyze that decision. A comparison of price-elasticity and cross-elasticity of demand highlights the market structure in which the firm operates and thereby an understanding of how a price change will impact the firm's total profit. Secondary issues involve classifying the cost of the firm's business activities and allocating those costs by sales revenue. The case has a difficulty level of three and is intended for use in junior-level courses. It can be covered in three hours, including a class presentation by a student team. The case requires a minimum of nine hours of outside preparation by students. This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply the knowledge they have gained in their lower-division, business core courses that include microeconomics, financial accounting, and managerial accounting. Specifically, the case incorporates the understanding of profit-maximizing pricing under monopoly and duopoly models of competition, how price and cross-elasticity of demand are interpreted, and how cost data can be organized for management decisions. Case Synopsis: Students view the case through Susan, a recent business graduate, who has struggled to find employment and lives with her parents. Susan is anxious to turn her paid internship into a job. She interns for a local, Internet service provider, Speedy DSL. Speedy has a profit margin that is below the industry average and faces strong competition from Timely Cable in the local broadband market. Currently, the two firms (Speedy and Timely) charge the same price for basic Internet connectivity that is similar in speed and reliability. Another Speedy intern, Matt, uses an estimated monopoly demand schedule and Speedy's own cost data to argue that Speedy should raise its price. Speedy's Marketing Director asks Susan for an evaluation of Matt's proposal. Susan has read industry reports with an estimate of the cross-elasticity of demand between DSL price and Cable subscriptions. Understanding that Timely's gain of customers would be Speedy's loss; students (placed into Susan's position) evaluate the impact of a price increase on Speedy's profit in a duopoly setting. Students must also categorize the cost of Speedy's business activities and show the breakdown of those costs against sales revenue. Instructor's Notes: Recommendation for Teaching: Approaches This case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course. The purpose of the course is to enable students to apply knowledge they have gained in the lower-division business core. In addition, the course aims to improve students' communication and teamwork skills. Student teams evaluate the issues presented in the case, perform the appropriate analysis, and recommend a course of action. All teams submit a formal, written business report containing their analysis and recommendations. One team of students formally presents their case analysis to the class. A second team of students acts as a ""discussion team"" by asking the presenting team for further explanation or clarification of their recommendations. Following the discussion team's exchange with the presenters, the entire class is welcome to participate in an active question and answer session. Although the case is designed for use in an upper-division, inter-disciplinary business course, the case can easily be modified for use as an in-class or take-home assignment in an introductory microeconomics course.",Marcal L.; Tontz R.,Strategic,,,5.0,,10,0,Allied Academies,"The case involves pricing decisions and an analysis of market structure, which align with long-term organizational goals and strategic planning.

"Purpose: This paper seeks to explore how Indian buying firms practise an open book (OB) policy in supplier relationships in three industries, i.e. the vehicle industry, the construction industry and the information technology industry. It also aims to study determinants of open book practices. Design/methodology/approach: Application of the OB policy is operationalised as the nature of open book practices, the extent and stage of data disclosed, the form of data disclosed, the direction of data disclosed, the attitude towards cost data disclosed, and the purpose and conditions of data disclosed. Determinants of the open book policy comprise characteristics of the exchange, the product, the buyer, the supplier and the supply market. Qualitative data were collected in the form of 22 interviews with representatives of three buying organisations and several of their suppliers in order to build three case studies. Findings: The results suggest that the OB policy is used by buyers for diverse purposes ranging from strategic to operational, for example value engineering at the product development stage, to ensure supplier margins, for self improvements and cost reductions, and country entry decisions. Similarly, the data shared ranged from narrow to wide in scope and scale. Suppliers' attitudes ranged from fairly neutral to very negative towards open books. Power asymmetries, the number of alternative suppliers, product performance characteristics and value, incentives offered, and buyer efforts were found to influence OB practices. Practical implications: Experiences gained from employing an OB policy in vehicle manufacturing suggests that firms in other industries can better leverage the use of open books for joint problem solving, equitable profit sharing and supplier selection. Originality/value: The paper highlights that an OB policy can have broader applicability than recognised by many past studies and indicates that it can serve purposes of strategic decision-making. It can also be an integrated part of a buyer's risk reduction strategy. Further, the study provides specific recommendations for Indian companies with regard to the application of an open book policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Kumra R.; Agndal H.; Nilsson U.,Strategic,10.1108/08858621211207225,Buyer-seller relationships; Buyer-supplier relationships; Buyers; India; Open book policy; Relationship marketing,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses an open book policy in supplier relationships, which is related to strategic decision-making in the context of organizational goals and long-term relationships.

"Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this modelbased recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by 18%. Further normative analysis sheds light on how crossmarket and carryover effects alter classical one-sided marketing budgeting rules. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Sridhar S.; Mantrala M.K.; Naik P.A.; Thorson E.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.10.0035,Kalman filter; Marketing budgeting; Marketing dynamics; Twosided markets,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the development and validation of a marketing response model, which is used to guide specific marketing investment decisions.

"Recent literature discusses movies and television as determinants of destinations’ image formation influencing tourists’ travel decisions. However, there still exists a lack of knowledge regarding the details of such screen-related influences on travel behaviour. This study attempts to shed light on these screen-related aspects and their role in influencing travel decisions and travel behaviour at the destination. In particular, it examines the role of the AustroGerman Sissi movies in attracting visitors to Vienna (Austria). The movies were shot during the 1950s and Vienna served as a major set for the movie. Based on a review of the major literature in the field of movie-induced tourism and the empirical survey the authors are able to derive implications for destination marketing and further research recommendations. Questionnaires were distributed amongst visitors of Sissi-related heritage sites. The findings support the importance of movie-induced tourism by illustrating that the Sissi movies contributed to travellers’ choice to visit Vienna and the film location. © 2011 Tourism Recreation Research.",Peters M.; Schuckert M.; Chon K.; Schatzmann C.,Strategic,10.1080/02508281.2011.11081317,Destination images; Movie-induced tourism; Sissi; Travel decisions,10.0,,10,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The study addresses the long-term impacts of movies on destination marketing and travel decisions, suggesting broader implications for tourism strategy and marketing goals.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Empire and romance: Movie-induced tourism and the case of the sissi movies,2011
"Purpose: Robert C. Pozen, Chairman Emeritus of MFS Investment Management and a long-time scholar of corporate governance, has proposed a model of professional board directorship that responds to the three main factors he believes underpin ineffective board decision making: the large size of boards; the lack of specific industry expertise; and inadequate director time commitment. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors critically evaluate the efficacy of Pozen's proposed corporate governance model, addressing the three main factors underpinning ineffective board decision making. Findings: A professional board consisting of retired executives with industry-specific expertise is vulnerable to a groupthink mentality, as well as to the availability of such individuals for board directorship seats. Moreover, while industry-specific expertise is a desired attribute of an independent board director, there are other attributes that firms are looking for, including international, regulatory/governmental, risk, technology, and marketing expertise. Lastly, Pozen's recommendations to reduce board size to seven members, as well as increasing the number of hours that independent directors spend on board-related activities (and commensurate compensation received), should be seriously considered as potential value-adding, corporate governance improvements. Originality/value: The authors critically evaluate a corporate governance model that, based on director-related issues arising from the recent global financial crisis, has resurrected the concept of a ""professional board"" of directors.

This study aims at assessing patients' perception towards the quality of health care services provided at the public hospitals affiliated to the Syrian ministry of health in Damascus. The results of (677) valid questionnaires revealed that patients had perceived positively the three dimensions of health care service quality which are: ""Health Care"", ""Health Personnel"", and ""Health Facilities"".

"This study investigates the current status of competitive intelligence (CI) practices in Malaysia, and how managers acquire and use CI from various sources. Data are collected through mail questionnaire survey from 123 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. More than half of the surveyed companies have a formal CI unit in their organisation. These units are mostly located within the marketing or market research or corporate planning department and has been established from 5 to 9 years. On average, 2 to 5 full-time personnel are assigned to take charge of CI activities. The top three sources managers acquire CI are newspapers and periodicals, the Internet and extranets, and customers. Whereas, the top three sources where CI is used in strategic decision making are customers, competitors, and newspapers and periodicals. In terms of source category, while the frequency of acquiring CI is higher from external impersonal sources, the frequency of using external and personal sources in strategic decision making is significantly higher than internal and impersonal sources.

"The study examines the research methodology of more than 200 empirical investigations of ethics in personal selling and sales management between 1980 and 2010. The review discusses the sources and authorship of the sales ethics research. To better understand the drivers of empirical sales ethics research, the foundations used in business, marketing, and sales ethics are compared. The use of hypotheses, operationalization, measurement, population and sampling decisions, research design, and statistical analysis techniques were examined as part of theory development and testing. The review establishes a benchmark, assesses the status and direction of the sales ethics research methodology, and helps inform researchers who need to deal with increasing amounts of empirical research. The investigation identified changing sources of publication with the Journal of Business Ethics and the Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management maintaining their position as the main conduit of high quality empirical sales ethics research. The results suggest that despite the use of theoretical models for empirical testing, a greater variety of moral frameworks and wider use of marketing exchange theory is needed. The review highlights many sound aspects about the empirical sales ethics research statistical methodology but also raises concerns about several areas.

"Purpose: Blogging has become part of a consumer's decision making process when shopping online; however, the understanding of blog recommendation's effect on consumer purchase decision is still vague. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the blog reader's trusting belief in the blogger is significant in relation to the perceived usefulness of the blogger's recommendations; and how the blog reader's perceptions influence his/her attitude and purchasing behavior online. The moderating effect of blogger's reputation on readers' purchasing intentions is also tested. Design/methodology/approach: Based on various theories, a model was proposed in this study. A survey involving 327 blog readers as participants was analyzed in the empirical study to investigate whether the usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trusting beliefs toward blogger had influence on consumers' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward online shopping. Findings: The results indicated that perceived usefulness of bloggers' recommendations and trust had significant influential effect on blog users' attitude towards and intention to shop online. Moreover, the findings showed that different determinants affected the users of perceived-high-reputation and perceived-low-reputation blogs. Originality/value: The findings suggest bloggers' electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to be a promising marketing strategy for increasing sales. The marketers should provide free trial products and services to the perceived-high-reputation bloggers who, as valued opinion leaders, will influence and prompt others to shop online through a trusting effect.

"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",Lambrecht A.; Tucker C.,Tactical,10.1509/jmr.11.0503,Construal level theory; Field experiments; Online advertising; Online decision process; Retargeting,5.0,,15,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effectiveness of dynamic retargeted ads versus generic ads in an online advertising context, which aligns with tactical decision-making related to campaign optimization and targeting strategies.",scopus-recommendation,15,65,When does retargeting work?

"Infant mortality and morbidity risk is linked to formula usage. The proportion of Filipino infant formula users rose 6% between 2003 and 2008. It is hypothesized this rise resulted from aggressive formula industry marketing.We conducted a household survey between April and December 2006 and focus groups in April-May 2007 in The Philippines to examine the association between mothers' exposure to advertising and other information sources and formula feeding decisions. Sixteen barangays (communities) were randomly selected from three purposively selected disadvantaged rural, urban and mixed municipalities. A total of 345 households had children under 24-months age: 114, 142 and 89 households from the rural, urban and mixed municipalities, respectively. In addition 38 respondents participated in 3 focus groups of 10-15 participants each, from three selected barangays.After adjusting for education and economic indicators logistic regression analysis showed that, children were more likely to be given formula if their mother recalled advertising messages, or a doctor, or mother or relative recommended it. Those using formula were 6.4 (1.8-23.1) times more likely to stop breastfeeding before 12 months. The focus groups described how television advertisements, doctors and medical representatives enticed them to use formula. We conclude that two factors were strongly associated with the decision to formula feed: self-reported advertising exposure, and physicians' recommendations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Sobel H.L.; Iellamo A.; Raya R.R.; Padilla A.A.; Olivé J.-M.; Nyunt-U S.,Out of scope,10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.08.029,Breast milk substitutes; Breastfeeding; Formula feeding; International code; Marketing; The Philippines,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract discusses infant formula usage and its association with advertising and physician recommendations, which falls under healthcare rather than marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Is unimpeded marketing for breast milk substitutes responsible for the decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines?

"Motivation is a subject that is constantly discussed in the field of education. Teachers are taught not only to teach their students, but to motivate them to want to learn. As students get older, intrinsic motivation tends to decrease; therefore it becomes more difficult for teachers to motivate students (Ryan and Deci, 2000a). According to self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci, 2000a, 2000b), students' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness must be met in order to experience positive social development and growth. When these needs are met, students experience high levels of self-motivation. Offering choice in the classroom is one way to increase student motivation by appealing to students' needs for autonomy and competence. In the fields of marketing, economics and social psychology, decision-making research is examined as a way to shape consumers' preferences. This literature review will aim to utilise and possibly translate some of these findings to an educational setting. By examining the aspect of choice in separate fields, it can be seen that there is still much to be researched in the field of education.

"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance- recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer-transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in ""choice mode."" Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Dellaert B.G.C.; Häubl G.,Operational,10.1509/jmr.09.0481,Behavioral search models; Consumer decision making; Product recommendations; Product search,10.0,,65,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses how recommendations in product search influence consumer decision-making processes, which aligns closely with day-to-day activities and consumer behavior management, typical of operational decisions.",scopus-recommendation,10,15,Searching in choice mode: Consumer decision processes in product search with recommendations,2012
"We measure the value of promotional activities and referrals by content creators to an online platform of user-generated content. To do so, we develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users. Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP) print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when ""free"" promotional activities by content creators exist. These free marketing campaigns are likely to have a substantial presence in most online services of user-generated content. © 2012 INFORMS.",Albuquerque P.; Pavlidis P.; Chatow U.; Chen K.-Y.; Jamal Z.,Tactical,10.1287/mksc.1110.0685,Demand modeling; Online marketing; Two-sided markets; User-generated content,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses measuring the value of promotional activities and referrals by content creators, which aligns with tactical decisions such as marketing analytics and sales promotion.

"Purpose of the Study. This study explores various outcomes associated with the incorporation of Twitter in the marketing classroom. To determine if Twitter use is a beneficial pursuit for marketing educators, we investigated classroom community, pedagogical effectiveness, and learning outcomes based on Twitter use and non-use within a required marketing course. Method/Design and Sample. For comparative purposes, a quasi-experimental design was employed across two semesters of the same undergraduate integrated marketing communications course. One semester (48 students) employed heavy Twitter use by both students and the instructor; the other semester had no Twitter use (36 students). Results. Independent sample t-tests (p <.05) were conducted to test the hypotheses.

"When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms' solutions and those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation, and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management approaches, and constraints.

"Customer relationship management is a continually evolving domain that has been particularly affected by social media, which have revolutionised the way businesses and consumers interact. This paper on social CRM builds on a previous model of CRM prior to the growth of social media (Jayachandran etal., 2005). We present a new model for social CRM, including a new construct of customer engagement initiatives and adaptations of other constructs to cater for the impact of social media. An online survey was used to collect data from a population of marketing practitioners and partial least squares analysis was used to test the model. Findings show the importance of an underlying customer relationship orientation; how it impacts on social media technology use and customer engagement initiatives, and also directly on customer relationship performance. A relationship is also shown between engagement and relational information processes, which is viewed as a performance outcome of social CRM.

"The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of a category management tool known as Category Optimizer™ at Foster's Wine Estates Americas for one of its brands, the Beringer California Collection. Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called Yellow Tail. Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market structure with the advances that have been made in assortment planning in operations research, assortment and stock-keeping-unit-level modeling, mixed logits, and the marketing literature on the perceptions of variety of assortment to develop and estimate a model on readily available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance market share. These were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact on its brand ranking. In fact, in 2008, it debuted as sixth among the international wine brands. It also managed to play an important role in deposing Yellow Tail, the market share leader, from its dominant position. We conclude the paper by providing examples of other companies where this approach has also been successfully implemented and by discussing some avenues for future research. ©2013 INFORMS.",Sinha A.; Sahgal A.; Mathur S.K.,Strategic,10.1287/mksc.1120.0746,Assortment; Brand portfolio; Category management; Disruptive innovations; Internal market structure; Perception of variety,5.0,,10,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The paper discusses the implementation of a category management tool aimed at long-term goals such as increasing profitability, improving competitive position, and defending against market entrants.

"The methodological discussion on the calibration of aggregate marketing response models has shifted away from how to obtain usable input for optimization toward how to avoid biases in statistical estimation. The purpose of this article is to remind researchers that such calibration is performed either to support managers in their marketing-mix decisions or to create general knowledge that leads to a better understanding of marketing relationships and thus indirectly supports decisions. Both goals require response models that are optimizable. The models must also be implementable if actual decision support is the objective. Herein, I identify several aspects for which these requirements are not always fulfilled: First, the appropriateness of the chosen functional form of the marketing response models is rarely discussed, although different forms imply quite different optimal solutions. Second, endogeneity is taken into account by structural equations, even though we lack sufficient information on how managers reach their decisions. Third, estimation methods for response models are often evaluated based on goodness-of-fit, while an assessment of their usefulness for subsequent optimization is neglected. Therefore, I provide recommendations for improving the current practice by better specifying the response function and undertaking more simulation-based evaluations of the best estimation method for use in subsequent optimization. With respect to implementation, usability can be facilitated using spreadsheets and heuristics. Moreover, gaining generalizable and replicable knowledge requires better documentation of results, which can be achieved through providing elasticities and as many details as are necessary to replicate a study, thereby enabling faster learning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Albers S.,Tactical,10.1016/j.ijresmar.2012.03.001,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the calibration of marketing response models to support managers in making marketing-mix decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making that interprets strategic goals into structured targets.

"Governments spend considerable public resources, including tax dollars, on marketing their cities or countries in order to become a strong brand attractive for exports, foreign direct investment and tourism. Ironically at the same time, self-imposed and strict visa regulations that can potentially hamper the productivity of marketing and branding are fairly common. There are valid reasons for imposing strict visa regulations, two of the most important being national and economic security. Although strict visa regulations are a common phenomenon around the world, the tourism academia have yet to argue against strict visa regulations by providing empirical evidence on their potential impact on tourism demand, and hence the economy. The current study is a pioneer attempt to generate awareness about the potential detrimental impacts of visa restrictions on a country's economy, by using the case of People's Republic of China, one of the countries known to have a history of strict visa regulations. The research reported in this paper was based on the standard tourism demand function, which models the causal relationship between tourism demand and a number of macroeconomic variables. The autoregressive distributed lag model (ADLM) was used since it has a dynamic specification that takes the time path of the tourist decision-making process into consideration by using both current and lagged values of variables.

"Case Description: The primary subject matter for this case involves strategic management, sustainability, international law, and business ethics. Firm positioning as an environmental leader represents agrowing strategic trend. Incorporating sustainable business policies is a practice that manystakeholders are demanding. With these concepts in mind, this case is most appropriate fordiscussion and analysis in undergraduate management, business law, or ethics courses wherethe topics of leadership, management, ethics, and sustainability are covered. This case is alsoappropriate for discussion in any courses where the instructor is ready to discuss ethics ininternational business and society. This case is designed to be taught in approximately one ortwo class sessions. Case Synopsis: This case describes the hypothetical management decisions Matt Lelander, a fictional marketing and purchasing manager of a British home improvement store, must make. The principle dilemma revolves around the choice of whether to continue purchasing lumber from the Latvian state owned lumber company. It has come to the attention of the purchasing manager, Matt Lelander that the rate of consumption of Latvian forests appears to be unsustainable. However, Matt realizes that the Latvian state lumber company is certified as a sustainable provider of lumber by the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Mr. Lelander is acutely aware that his customers value purchasing lumber from sustainably harvested sources and that they rely on FSC certification when making their purchases.

"A concept of consumers' behavior in social networks, which is interpreted as a study of the Internet consumers' activity in online associations and comprehension of their decision making in relation to the commodity purchase under the influence of marketing instruments relevant to their advancement in social networks with the aim satisfying the consumers' demands; making repeated purchases and providing loyalty towards a trade mark, has been specified in the article. it is determined that Facebook is widely used by Internet consumers of the European Union, whereas VKontakte (literally «in touch»), Odnoklassniki (literally «Classmates»), Twitter as well as Facebook are the most popular online associations in the Ukrainian Internet segment. The factors that induce Internet consumers to subscribe to brand accounts in social networks are the following: discounts, consumers' favourable attitude towards the brand, their personal interest in a brand, opinions and recommendations of their acquaintances, traditional advertising, media coverage, professional interest, social network posts. It has been found out that 57% of people in the developed countries do not want to contact with brands through social media. In the USA this number grows to 60%, in Great Britain to 61%. A barrier to advancement of brands through social networks in Ukraine is substantial. In our country almost half of all Internet consumers (49%) do not want companies or brands to contact with them. Although 54% of consumers in the world (47% in Ukraine) recognize that social networks are positioned correspondingly in order to get information about food; researches show that brands should care more about their online behavior.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the most important influencing factors in choosing a hospital by a patient. Design/methodology/approach: This study involved a mixed research design. Focus groups and in-depth individual interviews were conducted with patients to explore reasons for choosing a hospital. In addition, this study involved survey-based research on the patient choice. Findings: Type of the hospital, type of the service, word of mouth, cost of services, the health insurance programme, location, physical environment, facilities, providers' expertise and interpersonal behaviour, and reputation of the hospital influenced patients' choice of a hospital. Doctor recommendations and health insurance programme were the main reasons for choosing a hospital for inpatients and outpatients respectively. Practical implications: Identifying and understanding key factors that influence a patient choice of a healthcare setting helps managers and policy makers invest their resources in those critical areas and improve those aspects of their services to attract more patients.

"Purpose: The research goal of this study was to determine how flow experience and perceived behavioral control (PBC) affect participation behavior in the backpackers' forum. Design/methodology/approach: Subjects were self-selected by placing messages on over five recommendations members in the backpackers' forum. In total, 2,000 invitation messages were mailed to members of the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, of which 435 were returned completed (a return rate of 21.75 percent). Findings: As our analysis, flow experience in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community. Perceived enjoyment in a virtual community is positively associated with the behavioral intentions to use the virtual community, and behavioral intentions to visit a virtual community are positively associated with the member's actual participation in a virtual community. Research limitations/implications: While this study has produced meaningful data for the development of multidimensional measures of factors that influence participation behavior in the Taiwanese backpackers' forum, the validity of an instrument cannot be firmly established on the basis of a single study. All of the data used for tests were collected only from a single backpackers' forum. Practical implications: Our study shows that travel agencies must become technologically astute to keep up with its customers, should be viewing the internet as a vital distribution channel for marketing, and should be linked to other well-known reservation web sites. Social implications: The backpacker community served as a reference group that could significantly influence travelers' beliefs, attitudes, and choices. Originality/value: In the present study we found that a basic understanding of the essence of the backpacker community is a prerequisite for any organization operating a travel-oriented community if they are to be clear about their mission, purpose, and the right direction to take to achieve their goal. That goal will increase the commitment of the members to a virtual community by increasing their helping behavior and active participation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Ku E.C.S.,Tactical,10.1108/10662241111139318,Recommendations; Travel; Virtual worlds,5.0,,20,0,,"The study focuses on understanding behavioral intentions and participation in a virtual community, which aligns with interpreting strategic goals into more structured targets, such as user engagement and participation behavior.",scopus-recommendation,15,60,Recommendations from a virtual community as a catalytic agent of travel decisions,2011
"The increasing demand for chicken meat has caused producers to increase their productivity through enhanced production techniques. Further increase in demand for quality meat products has been predicted in the country. This study seeks to investigate factors that influence consumer perception toward chicken meat quality. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 569 consumers at selected shopping malls located in Klang Valley areas. The majority of the respondents perceived quality as an important criterion for buying decisions. The finding revealed that nine factors have influenced consumer perception on meat quality, namely color, size, springiness, chicken aroma, fatty/oily taste, sweetness, visible fat, tenderness, and fibrousness. Among these factors, tenderness was found to be the most important criterion that influenced consumer preference toward chicken meat quality during buying decisions. Good production practices and proper marketing strategies are among recommendations to poultry industry players toward fulfilling consumer demand for good quality chicken meat. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Imran S.N.; Kamarulzaman N.H.; Latif I.A.; Mohd Nawi N.,Tactical,10.1080/10454446.2014.921878,awareness; chicken meat; consumer; perception; quality,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The abstract discusses specific factors influencing consumer perception of chicken meat quality, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"This study investigates tourist behaviour in the Canton of Ticino Switzerland, a geographically dispersed destination, by analysing use patterns of a ‘destination card’ sold by the local destination management organization. Destination cards offer free or highly discounted entry into partner attractions and activities often coupled with free public transport access in the area. Within this context, the study sought to determine if evidence of concentrated behaviour existed, either spatially or by activity. Cluster analysis revealed four discrete market segments. Three of them showed a high degree of spatial concentration in their movements, augmented by some clearly defined activity preferences. The fourth showed no clear pattern, travelling widely throughout the Canton and sampling a range of activities. Hence, the combination of transport and attractions’ entrance appeals to two different user groups, one looking to gain access to attractions and one seeking ease of transport. Discriminant analysis further supported the results with defining the determinant variables of the cluster membership and confirmed that the point of sales has an important role in identifying the consumption of activities and the extension of the area visited. Thus, to conceptualize the decision process in an intra-destination level, the spatial structure of the destination seems to play a greater influence on behaviour than its product structure. The paper illustrates how analysis of destination card data can assist destinations in better understanding their markets and discusses potential research opportunities that can generate real marketing benefits. A number of recommendations especially for destination managers and tourism operators are also identified to enhance the information gathered. Product bundling, regional cooperation and strategic marketing opportunities at sales points are suggested in this context to further incentivize tourist mobility. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Zoltan J.; McKercher B.,Tactical,10.1080/14616688.2014.927523,activity consumption; destination card; discriminant analysis; intra-destination movement patterns; segmentation; Ticino,5.0,,15,0,Routledge,"The study analyzes tourist behavior and provides recommendations for destination managers and tourism operators to enhance marketing strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Purpose: Marketers devote great efforts to maintaining brand value. However, brand value can come under attack in the absence of sufficient product performance and image differentiation in a process called unbranding. This paper aims to provide insights and guidelines that will give marketing managers tools to deal with variables that impact consumer decisions on whether to buy a national brand or a store brand product. Design/methodology/approach: A consumer research study was based on a random, mall intercept with 188 respondents consisting of seven questions scored on a ten-point scale. The results are presented on a set of graphs accompanied with some analysis of means (ANOM) applications. Findings: Results indicated that a significant portion of consumers (from over 40 percent to a high of 85 percent) feel that the quality differences between branded and generic products have diminished and the price premiums charged by branded products are often no longer justifiable. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study imply that in branded product premium image must be maintained and enhanced, otherwise it will be lost. In addition, the trend of brand value loss referred to as unbranding will vary significantly by and within a product category. Practical implications: Branded products must maintain their superior consumer perception and product performance. Store or generic brand marketers should exploit the favorable price-value relationship gained because of the loss of brand value through a process of store branding. Originality/value: The new concept of unbranding is introduced together with research-based recommendations for brand value protection strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Mayer P.; Vambery R.G.,Strategic,10.1108/07363761311304951,Brand identity; Brand values; Differentiation; Generics; Price-to-value; Store brands; Unbranding,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of brand value and introduces the concept of unbranding, which relates to strategic brand management and positioning in the marketplace.

"Social media technologies have greatly facilitated the creation of many types of user-generated information, e.g., product rating information can be used to generate preference-based recommendation. As a decision support tool, a Recommendation Agent (RA) has been widely adopted by many e-commerce websites. The impact of RAs on online shopping has been extensively examined in the IS literature. However, from Marketing and Social Media perspectives, the widely adopted cognitive-affect-conative-action framework of customer loyalty has not been tested in the presence of RAs. Moreover, there has been little research assessing the impact of increasing consumer knowledge about specific product domains on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Based on these important constructs, this study proposes and empirically tests a parsimonious model assessing the moderating effect of consumer product knowledge and online shopping experience on using RA for customer loyalty. The results show that consumer product knowledge relationship between RA's recommendations negatively impacts the recommendation quality and customer satisfaction, however, consumer online shopping experience does not have a significant effect on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. The results make a significant contribution to a better understanding of the constructs in our research model and provide evidence useful for the management of websites using RAs for product recommendations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Yoon V.Y.; Hostler R.E.; Guo Z.; Guimaraes T.,Tactical,10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.024,Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction with website; Customer value; Intelligent agents; Online shopping experience; Product knowledge,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the use of Recommendation Agents (RAs) in e-commerce, focusing on their impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

"Sociologists have long recognized that economic decisions are socially embedded. Management sciences and business practices have gradually begun to incorporate this idea. With the rise of the Internet, large-scale data are available on friendships, recommendations, transactions and social interactions, which have led to a strong momentum for research in this area. The aim of this article is to inspire multidisciplinary research on the mechanisms and consequences of social embeddedness on decision making and to highlight opportunities and challenges by synthesizing findings from various fields, such as IS research, sociology, economics, marketing and other management disciplines.

"A study is reported that investigates the goals underlying undergraduate students' engagement in their major classes, nonmajor classes, and in extracurricular activities. The qualitative study employs both focus groups and goal-mapping exercises. The results suggest that students tend to focus on utilitarian, attribute-level considerations mainly related to credentialing for purposes of employment. The results are considered from the perspectives of judgment and decision making, learning models, and the emerging service marketing perspective. These model considerations underscore an argument for moving toward models of education delivery focusing on value co-creation instead of the current emphasis on providing value to students. A series of recommendations are offered to help facilitate faculty efforts to increase course engagement, particularly in large-section course offerings. However, the authors ultimately conclude that student engagement with their course-related experiences will best be served in models of value co-creation by a focus on more than intellectual maturity in education. Specifically, an argument is presented for also targeting moral and motivational maturity.

"The paper analyses the tourist's first stay booking decision and the factors (such as advertising, word-of-mouth, and travel agency recommendation) that most significantly influence it. Three research hypotheses have been considered and a logistic regression model has been specified. The factors ""advertising"" and ""word-of-mouth"" have significant power to explain direct-contact booking. Hence, there is not only a strong association between first stay booking and the Web, but also a very strong association between the booking and the recommendation of someone close to the tourist who has previously stayed at the hotel. This means that these are two important sources of information for inducing the tourist's decision in this respect.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine shelf management practices of grocery retail chains and their category captains (CCs) in the marketing of consumer packaged goods. Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative, exploratory study that is set in a duopoly retail environment in the Asia-Pacific region. The study employed 18 in-depth interviews with executives and managers of two umbrella retail organisations and their suppliers/manufacturers. The method of data analysis employed was content analysis. Findings – Despite CC input in merchandising decisions, it is the retail chains that have the final say on shelf matters. There is no risk of strategic loss of power in employing CCs to manage store product categories on behalf of, or in partnership with retailers provided the retail chains closely monitor the activities and decisions/recommendations of the captains. Research limitations/implications – The paper is developed from data obtained from the grocery retail industry of one economy. Future research would need to extend this study to other economies with similar as well as different conditions. Practical implications – The research offers reassurance to grocery retail practitioners who may be contemplating lessening the burden of managing all their store categories by themselves and switching to CC arrangements. The reassurance is that the reported risk associated with loss of power is manageable.

"As direct-to-consumer marketing of medical genetic tests grows in popularity, there is an increasing need to better understand the ethical and public policy implications of such products. The complexity of genetic tests raises serious concerns about whether consumers possess the knowledge to make sound decisions about their use. This research examines the effects of educational intervention and feedback on consumers' genetic literacy and calibration-the gap between consumers' actual knowledge and how much they think they know. The authors find that consumers' genetic knowledge was generally low and that people tended to underestimate their knowledge level. Furthermore, consumers' perceived rather than actual knowledge levels drove attitude and purchase intention. Regarding the effect of educational intervention, exposure to an online educational module improved both genetic knowledge and calibration. Offering instant feedback resulted in greater knowledge gain than delayed feedback. The worst learning outcome occurred when feedback was both delayed and brief. On the basis of these findings, the authors offer recommendations for formulating ethically sound public policies in this area. © 2012 American Marketing Association.",Pearson Y.E.; Liu-Thompkins Y.,Tactical,10.1509/jppm.10.066,Direct-to-consumer marketing; Genetic literacy; Genetics education; Knowledge calibration; Marketing ethics,5.0,,20,5,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses the effects of educational intervention on consumer genetic literacy and the implications for marketing genetic tests, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,60,Consuming direct-to-consumer genetic tests: The role of genetic literacy and knowledge calibration,2012
"Today's consumers are empowered with online shopper reviews which are mostly written and posted by buyers, customers, users, or visitors at a website. Shopper reviews will become more popular and ubiquitous in e-tailing in the near future. However, the marketing literature is still limited when it comes to knowledge of how shoppers perceive and use online reviews in their purchase decisions. Hence, this study explored shoppers' predispositions toward positive or negative reviews and examined the impact of consumers' attitudes and usage patterns on their perceived helpfulness and credibility of online shopper/peer reviews. One interesting finding from our study of 342 online shoppers was that consumers who would pay greater attention to positive reviews gave reviews more credible and usefulness ratings than their counterparts who would focus on the negative reviews. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Ong B.S.,Tactical,10.1080/10496491.2011.597304,Consumer recommendations; Online shopper reviews; Online word-of-mouth; Perceived credibility; Product reviews; Website promotion,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses consumer attitudes and behaviors regarding online shopper reviews, which relates to how businesses can optimize their marketing strategies and understand consumer engagement.

"This article addresses self-gift giving both from a consumer perspective and from the point of view of brands' promotional messages. Self-gifts may be regarded as personal acquisitions which are distinguished from other purchases by a particular motivation and context - quite literally, gifts to oneself. Our knowledge of this phenomenon from the consumer side remains limited, despite evidence of its importance in understanding consumer decisions. Furthermore, there is no empirical research addressing the extent to which organisations make use of the concept of self-gifts in their marketing activities. This paper addresses these gaps using a two-stage methodology. First, it enhances the understanding of self-gift consumer behaviour (SGCB) by 14 in-depth interviews with consumers. Then, drawing on the self-gift themes which emerged from the interviews, it presents the results of a content analysis of marketing communications for two selected product categories.

"Within the arts and culture sector, bundling is a commonly used strategy that consists in marketing a combination of products in a single package. Drawing from current examples in the arts and culture industry, the study presented in this article examines how different bundling strategies affect consumer decisions and perceptions. An experiment was conducted among a sample of 200 adult consumers where the complementarity of bundle items (complementary vs. noncomplementary) and mode of selection of bundle items (additive vs. subtractive) were jointly manipulated by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Consistent with previous research, the results showed that consumers who construct an arts and culture bundle in a subtractive fashion end up with a greater number of items and a more expensive bundle. However, the impact of mode of selection on the bundle's perceived value was shown to depend on the complementarity of the items. These findings suggest that the recommendation of avoiding bundling noncomplementary products usually put forward in the bundling literature must be evaluated through a consideration of the type of strategy that is used to build the bundle. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Darveau J.; d'Astous A.,Tactical,10.1002/mar.20720,,5.0,,30,0,Wiley-Liss Inc.,"The study focuses on specific bundling strategies within the arts and culture sector and their direct effects on consumer decision-making.

"Subject area: The area of focus is on internationalization strategies, specifically on developing suitable strategies to support an internationalization initiative of a new medical device company. Study level/applicability: This case is designed for final year undergraduate and MBA students. It is suitable for courses of organizational management, organization theory and design, strategic management, and international business as well as international marketing. Case overview: GranuLab, a medical device company that produced the synthetic bone graft substitute GranuMaS, aspired to be a high-growth company. To achieve this aspiration the company had made plans for internationalization, which include penetrating the ASEAN, Middle East, Latin American, and African markets within the next five years. By December 2010, GranuLab had completed the construction of its new manufacturing facility in Shah Alam, about 30km from Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur. This manufacturing facility had the capability to produce high volumes to support the company's high growth plan. However, the company's internationalization processes had taken longer than expected and this has led to a low business volume. By mid-2012, the company was forced to make a quick decision as it had suffered a year and a half of operations losses. GranuLab had to formulate a strategy as to how to position GranuMaS and penetrate the targeted markets. Failure to internationalize would incur even greater losses and might hinder the achievement of its high growth aspiration by 2015. Expected learning outcomes: This case is designed to stimulate case analysts' thinking into providing recommendations for the appropriate internationalization strategies to be adopted by the management team to ensure that the company could succeed in achieving its goals. The case will expose students to the concepts and theories of strategic management, international business, international entrepreneurship; and facilitate the development of students' abilities to apply those concepts in managerial situations.

"Although the new middle classes in emerging markets are a matter of significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, there has been little systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological sensibilities informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these sensibilities are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class sensibilities, which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These sensibilities crystallize into a particular mode of consumption - ""formulaic creativity"" - which addresses consumers' desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies.

"Marketing experience is a new area, yet little examined marketing theorists and practitioners. However, the recent period has increasingly focused on the concept of experience marketing and its practical application. Many service companies recognize that business success depends on the user experience development and management, because satisfied customers are likely to repeat purchases and verbal recommendations. The paper aims to theoretically reason the possibilities of applying experience marketing in the sector of hospitality services. In order to reveal the conceptualization of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, was made extensive theoretical studies of experience/experiential marketing and hospitality sector. This article presents the theoretical model of experience marketing in the hospitality services sector, which consists of two structural components: 1. reflects the client/guest experience levels and types as well as the activities of company; 2. the customer/guest behavioural consequences (results), which depends on what kind of experience customers receives. Model specification and theoretical analysis of the study showed that the hospitality service companies should use the experience marketing tools, because the main task of companies providing hospitality services is to make a customer become a steady visitor/customer, since his/her decisions and actions will depend in the future on his/her ""positive"", ""unforgettable"", ""unique"" experience while facing with service provider or brand.",Verbauskiene L.; Griesiene I.,Strategic,,Experience; Experience marketing; Experiential marketing; Sector of hospitality,5.0,,10,5,Vilnius University,"The abstract discusses the theoretical framework of experience marketing in the hospitality sector, emphasizing the long-term implications of customer experience on business success, which aligns with strategic planning.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Conceptualization of experience marketing in the sector of hospitality services,2014
"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%.

"The use of evidence-based medical practice has become the standard for health care decision-making. Thus, it has become increasingly important for medical device manufactures to provide evidence for the efficacy of their products. As new products, services, and solutions are developed, it is important to perform a stakeholder analysis to assess clinical evidence needs. As evidenced by the variety of stakeholders in clinical trials, we expect that each has different interests in how clinical trials are developed, conducted, and promoted to the general public. This analysis of the stakeholders' concerns provides recommendations for marketing professionals on meeting the needs of these stakeholders. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Droms C.M.; Ferguson M.; Giuliano K.,Out of scope,10.1080/07359683.2014.876884,clinical trials; communication strategy; decision making; health care; stakeholder analysis,,0.0,0,100,,"The abstract focuses on evidence-based medical practice and stakeholder analysis in the healthcare domain, which is not related to marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,The Stakeholder Approach: A New Perspective on Developing and Marketing Clinical Trials,2014
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to bring forth the limitations of some important models of cognition and behavior adopted by social marketers and present important findings from recent lines of research that contribute to a fine-grained understanding of human behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that presents a review of several theoretical approaches to human cognition and behavior and their implications regarding social marketing campaigns. Findings: It is concluded that the assumptions underlying traditional models of behavior need to be revised, especially the assumption that human beings are rational decision makers - the prototypical homo economicus. Behavioral science has revealed that people are far from being rational and are prone to be influenced by myriad factors, some deemed irrelevant under rational models. Social marketing interventions have greater probability of success when they rely on more realistic assumptions of human behavior. Research limitations/implications: Social marketing needs to embrace the contributions of the several disciplines and lines of research centered on the study of all facets of human behavior, such as behavioral economics and dual-system framework. Practical implications: The main implications are: the recommendation to assume people are running on their System 1 when they are in contact with social marketing campaigns, the need to consider the interplay of systems and selves over time, the recommended emphasis on place strategies, and the need to avoid cash incentives and silver bullets. Originality/value: The value of this paper is in contrasting the assumptions of traditional models of cognition and behavior widely used in social marketing with the evidence from several lines of research portraying influences in human behavior not accounted by those models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Carvalho H.C.; Mazzon J.A.,Strategic,10.1108/JSOCM-11-2011-0080,Cognition; Consumer attitudes; Consumer behaviour; Social marketing; Social marketing theory; Theory of planned behaviour,10.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the need to revise traditional models of cognition and behavior in social marketing, emphasizing a long-term understanding of human behavior and its implications for social marketing campaigns.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,Homo economicus and social marketing: Questioning traditional models of behavior,2013
"Case Description: This case asks the students to recommend a decision to a group of individuals on whether or not to pursue purchasing The Shoppes at Riverside, even when the purchase price is minimal ($1). It is based on the actual experiences of one of the authors. The Shoppes at Riverside is a unique business located in a historic building in a downtown area. The store occupies approximately 5,500 square feet of space (leased from a local foundation) and subleases space to dealers selling upscale merchandise including art, antiques, home accessories, and gift items. The store charges a monthly rent to each dealer (based on their booth square footage) along with a 10% commission on sales. The students are given basic information provided by the present owner and are asked to evaluate the information given to project monthly cash flows and then to make a recommendation to the potential purchasers. They are also asked to evaluate and suggest other lines of business that might be added to the present business to increase the profitability of the store. This case is appropriate to use in an Intro to Small Business Class as the size of the business is ideal for any course that emphasizes entrepreneurs or small businesses. This assignment can be completely individually or as a group assignment. Case Synopsis: The primary focus of the case is a purchase decision. The information given to the students to utilize in formulating their decision includes store sales by month for each of the last three years as well as operating expenses. From the information given, the students are asked to construct pro- forma cash flows for the year 2007 by month based on their assumptions regarding sales and occupancy levels. They are also asked to research other product lines the potential buyers could add to the store to complement the present merchandise presently being sold by dealers. Although the store does collect rental income, there is a cap on percentage rents at 10% of sales which in turn limits the total revenues of the store. The students are given some ideas on lines of business to research within the questions of the case. They may have others they would also like to research. A second phase of the case analysis would be to break the case into group assignments and have each group research and prepare presentation on such topics as (1) the various type of advertising options and the related costs applicable to small retail businesses in order to develop and implement a marketing plan; (2) the type of business formation available to small businesses (i.e. Corporation, Sub-S Corporation, Partnership, LLP; (3) additional product lines to add to increase revenues of the business; and (4) the advantages and disadvantages of developing a website and selling ""on-line"" with this type of business. As a result of the individual and group projects, classroom discussions could be held based on the findings of the groups as well as other current issues faced by small businesses. The advantage of this case is that it presents students with a real-life purchase decision and presents relevant topics for in-class discussions.",Carter F.L.; Heriot K.,Tactical,,,5.0,,15,0,,"The case involves making specific recommendations on purchasing a business and evaluating operational aspects such as cash flows, business lines, and marketing strategies, which aligns with tactical decision-making in interpreting strategic goals into actionable targets.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,The shoppes at riverside,2010
"Purpose-With the introduction of the mandatory European Union (EU) organic logo for all organic food products in 2010, the European Commission aimed at fostering the internal organic food market. This needs consumers’ knowledge of the logo. According to earlier research consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo is low. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to elicit consumers’ attitudes towards organic certification and labelling and to develop recommendations on how to improve consumers’ knowledge of the EU organic logo. Design/methodology/approach-By means of an online survey with 3,000 participants in six European countries, knowledge of the logo and attitudes towards organic farming and European labelling, as well as organic food purchase behaviour and socio-demographic indicators were elicited. Factor and cluster analysis based on several statements on the test persons’ attitudes towards organic farming and corresponding EU legislation were conducted in order to segment consumers. Findings-The results indicate that knowledge of the logo is low. Only about 15 per cent of all respondents knew its meaning. Four clusters of consumers could be identified: “Committed organics”, “Pragmatic organics”, “Organic sceptics” and Organic disinteresteds’. With reference to the EU organic legislation’s aim of promoting the organic market, particularly “Organic sceptics” should be addressed by emphasising the trustworthiness of the organic certification and labelling system. Originality/value-Segmenting consumers according to their attitude towards organic farming, its labelling and certification allows for targeted and efficient communication and organic market development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Zander K.; Padel S.; Zanoli R.,Tactical,10.1108/BFJ-08-2014-0298,Attitude-behaviour discrepancy; Communication; Consumer attitudes; Consumer purchasing decisions; Organic marketing; Product information,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses the analysis of consumer attitudes and knowledge regarding the EU organic logo, aiming to develop targeted recommendations for improving this knowledge.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the impacts of the size and timing of sales compensations, the management stringency of the insurer and the insurance broker's own moral views on product recommendations made by the brokers. Design/methodology/approach – The data used in this research were gathered from life insurance broker companies in Taiwan. Findings – The results showed that the sales compensations, perceived leniency of the insurer's underwriting and claim policy would affect the product recommendations made by the brokers. Practical implications – Insurance brokers are one of the most important marketing channels in the insurance industry. However, using the insurance brokers to sell insurance may result in some ethical problems. For example, some insurance brokers may sell insurance to high-risk customers because the high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance and that means more sales compensations can be earned. The findings of this research may have some implications for insurance management and insurance regulation. Originality/value – This study contributes to the understanding of insurance brokers' responses to adverse selection problems (high-risk customers may prefer to buy more insurance) and product recommendation decisions. The issue has been less mentioned in the financial regulation literature. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Tseng L.-M.; Kang Y.-M.,Tactical,10.1108/JFRC-08-2012-0031,Insurance brokers; Moral; Product recommendation; Sales compensation; Underwriting,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The study explores how sales compensations and management policies affect the specific product recommendations made by insurance brokers, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,"The influences of sales compensations, management stringency and ethical evaluations on product recommendations made by insurance brokers",2014
"Market orientation can be defined as the company’s ability to systematically generate relevant information about current and latent customer needs, spread this information across all company departments and use this information in decision making and subsequent behavior. Current research proves that market orientation correlates strongly with profitability. Strengthening market orientation should therefore be the main focus of the marketing department. However, over the last years, marketers within companies have faced serious criticism coming from the top management as well as from other business functions. This criticism stems from the generally shared opinion that marketing expenditures tend to rise whereas marketing effectiveness and efficiency seem to decline over time, as proved by relatively low satisfaction and loyalty levels of customers and their resistance towards marketing activities. This study investigates the main barriers of marketing effectiveness and efficiency within companies. Based on two focus groups with senior Czech marketing managers we revealed several key themes that reflect how local marketers perceive their jobs. We identified that marketing departments differ diametrically in activities they execute, that marketers face image problem within their companies and that they are not able to prove return of their activities sufficiently. Furthermore, we individuated barriers specific for our context not found in the literature. However, companies of different size and sectors have specifics which are discussed in the text. Managerial recommendations are added. All of these findings should be of high importance for both CEOs (resp. owners) and marketers, because increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the marketing function is their common goal. ©, 2014, Technical University of Liberec.

"The present study evaluates the value of tourists' blogs as a research data source by using them to evaluate the tourist experience and to assess their influence on the decision-making process of prospective tourists. The blogs of 103 tourists visiting South Tyrol, 32 written in English and 71 written in Italian, were analyzed using textual and image content analysis. The text of 246 comments posted to these blogs was analyzed to evaluate the possible influence of bloggers' narrative on prospective tourists. The results show cultural differences in the way tourists use blogs. Italian blogs appear to have more potential to influence the decision-making process of prospective visitors since their comments often contain recommendations and authors' declaration of their own future intentions to travel to South Tyrol. They also demonstrate significant potential for revealing market-relevant aspects of tourists' experience although they do not always convey the 'experience essence'. © The Author(s) 2010.",Volo S.,Tactical,10.1177/1356766710380884,blogs; destination marketing; Italy; South Tyrol; unobtrusive research methods; user generated content,5.0,,15,0,,"The study evaluates tourists' blogs as a data source for understanding tourist experiences and influences on decision-making, which aligns with tactical marketing strategies such as consumer engagement and marketing analytics.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Bloggers' reported tourist experiences: Their utility as a tourism data source and their effect on prospective tourists,2010
"Since social marketing's formal introduction in 1971, the field has advanced through employing innovations in marketing thought. Despite debates over whether or not marketing principles should be used to promote socially beneficial behaviors, the field has become successful at utilizing such practices to achieve its goals. However, even with these advancements, social marketing research has yet to fully consider how the use of traditional marketing practices in socially oriented settings can alter the way stakeholders perceive and interact with the organizations employing these tactics. This article examines how parallels between nonprofit management and social marketing research illustrate how socially oriented organizations can damage their legitimacy as change agents and community partners by not evaluating the true costs of employing marketing techniques. Both warnings and recommendations are provided to help the managers of social marketing efforts more effectively evaluate both the costs and benefits of their decisions. © The Author(s) 2012.",Polit S.,Strategic,10.1177/1524500412450491,Best practices; Monitoring and evaluation; Partnerships,10.0,,10,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the long-term implications of using marketing practices in socially oriented organizations, focusing on how these practices can affect their legitimacy and relationships with stakeholders.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to establish and identify the target market of a proposed residential development in Gaborone using the STP strategy. Research design/methodology/approach - Both non-probability and probability sampling techniques were used by applying qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews and questionnaire) were used to get research data in order to meet the objective of the study. A survey instrument using a self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered to the respondents who were working earning a monthly salary was used in order to meet the minimum qualifying criteria for a home loan being 30% of one's income to service mortgage payments. Significance - The study is relevant to developers who just develop/invest scarce resources without establishing the need/demand for the product. It will be a lesson learnt for those developers who shun/disregard the input of market research in the process of decision making for housing property development. Findings - The study established that this was the first research of its kind within the housing market. It also revealed that target market identification is critical in market research because it help the developer to minimise the unsystematic and systematic risks which might affect the success of the development project thereby impacting on the profitability of the business. It will also help them appreciate by positioning the product in the minds of the target market through offering the product with features that the customers are looking for. From the developer's point of view, they will be fulfilling the customer's needs by implementing the recommendations and results of the market research report. Once these needs are met and fulfilled, the property listing period is also reduced at the time of marketing the property and customers are identified even before the propduct is developed thus adding value to the business.

To reveal the relationships among physicians, pharmacists, and consumers, pharmacists and consumers were surveyed using existing questionnaires. The findings indicate recommendations from pharmacists' that patients consult with physicians about the choice of lower priced, though acceptable, prescription and over-the-counter drugs have a significant effect on consumer decisions.

"The authors designed and ran an experiment to measure social influence in online recommender systems, specifically, how often people's choices are changed by others' recommendations when facing different levels of confirmation and conformity pressures. In this experiment, participants were first asked to provide their preference from pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of other people's preferences. The results show that other people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) rather than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, whereas demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",Zhu H.; Huberman B.A.,Operational,10.1177/0002764214527089,conformity theory; social influence; social media and choices,5.0,,60,5,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses an experiment that measures how social influence affects consumer choices in online recommender systems, which aligns with managing day-to-day consumer decision-making activities.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,To Switch or Not To Switch: Understanding Social Influence in Online Choices,2014
"Title: Shavteli Winery: where to go from here? Subject area: International marketing, national competitiveness, strategic decision‐making, wine. Study level/applicability: Undergraduate and MBA. Case overview: The nationally important Georgian wine industry by 2008 was in a deep recession due largely to the continuing 2006 Russian wine embargo, prior to which Russia had been the largest export market for Georgian wines. Second World War‐era Georgian wineries such as Shavteli (disguised), in the historic Racha‐Lechkumi wine‐producing region, were disadvantaged due to aging facilities, lack of tourist infrastructure, and inadequate capital to make needed changes to compete in the global markets for emerging economy wines. All nearby wineries faced continuing operating deficits, high inventory levels, and could lose much of their aging wine inventory to oxidation if they could not quickly sell more wine or convert the wine to brandy. To avert becoming another defunct producer, Shavteli needed a strategy. Industry observers were divided about whether Shavteli and its sister Georgian wineries should continue operating independently, seek government support, or form a marketing association to create new export demand. Students need to prepare a strategic plan for Shavteli and the Georgian wine industry. Expected learning outcomes: Students should develop well‐supported recommendations for competitive strategies in an emerging economy. Students should use strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and country competitiveness analyses to ascertain vision and mission, segmentation, targeting, positioning, and alliance strategies for international markets.

"CASE DESCRIPTION: The primary subject matter for this case involves strategic management, sustainability, international law, and business ethics. Firm positioning as an environmental leader represents a growing strategic trend. Incorporating sustainable business policies is a practice that many stakeholders are demanding. With these concepts in mind, this case is most appropriate for discussion and analysis in undergraduate management, business law, or ethics courses where the topics of leadership, management, ethics, and sustainability are covered. This case is also appropriate for discussion in any courses where the instructor is ready to discuss ethics in international business and society. This case is designed to be taught in approximately one or two class sessions. CASE SYNOPSIS: This case describes the hypothetical management decisions Matt Lelander, a fictional marketing and purchasing manager of a British home improvement store, must make. The principle dilemma revolves around the choice of whether to continue purchasing lumber from the Latvian state owned lumber company. It has come to the attention of the purchasing manager, Matt Lelander that the rate of consumption of Latvian forests appears to be unsustainable. However, Matt realizes that the Latvian state lumber company is certified as a sustainable provider of lumber by the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Mr. Lelander is acutely aware that his customers value purchasing lumber from sustainably harvested sources and that they rely on FSC certification when making their purchases. Further, Mr Lelander is presented some legally challenging issues with regards to contract performance and bribery. The case provides detailed background information on the Latvian state owned lumber company, FSC, the current situation of Latvian forests, applicable laws, ethical frameworks, and competitive market considerations.

"Online social networks (OSN) are technology-enabled relationship tools in which a user creates a profile, connects to other individuals, and shares user-generated content with them. One of the many features OSN offer is the ability to post messages in the form of product and service recommendations. Although word-of-mouth research has examined this type of personal communication to intentionally influence consumer decisions, limited understanding exists regarding when a user acts upon a recommendation received from one of their contacts. In this study, we draw on relationship theories and research on trust to analyze the impact relationship characteristics and behaviors of the OSN contacts have on trust in the recommendation that subsequently leads a user to act on this OSN contact's recommendation. The results of a survey of 116 OSN users showed that closeness, excessive posting behavior, and past recommendation experience have a positive impact on trust and intention to act on the recommendation. One characteristic of the relationships, that is, similarity, however, does not affect recommendation trust in the context of OSN. The findings enhance our understanding of relationships and their defining characteristics in OSN. The results also provide insights into how companies might leverage OSN in their marketing efforts. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.",Matook S.; Brown S.A.; Rolf J.,Tactical,10.1057/ejis.2013.28,,5.0,,15,0,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,"The study focuses on how relationship characteristics in online social networks influence trust and intention to act on recommendations, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing, such as user engagement and customer acquisition strategies.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Forming an intention to act on recommendations given via online social networks,2015
"Background: New oral anticoagulants have similar efficacy and lower bleeding rates compared with warfarin. However, in case of bleeding there is no specific antidote to reverse their effects. We evaluated the preferences and values of anticoagulants of patients at risk of atrial fibrillation and those who have already made a decision regarding anticoagulation. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of Veterans in the primary care clinics and the international normalized ratio (INR) laboratory. We developed an instrument with patient and physician input to measure patient values and preferences. The survey contained a hypothetical scenario of the risk of atrial fibrillation and the attributes of each anticoagulant. After the scenario, we asked participants to choose the option that best fits their preferences. The options were: 1) has better efficacy at reducing risk of stroke; 2) has been in the market for a long period of time; 3) has an antidote to reverse the rare case of bleeding; 4) has better quality of life profile with no required frequent laboratory tests; or 5) I want to follow physician recommendations. We stratified our results by those patients who are currently exposed to anticoagulants and those who are not exposed but are at risk of atrial fibrillation. Results: We approached 173 Veterans and completed 137 surveys (79% response rate). Ninety subjects were not exposed to anticoagulants, 46 reported being on warfarin, and one reported being on dabigatran at the time of the survey. Ninety-eight percent of subjects stated they would like to participate in the decision-making process of selecting an anticoagulant. Thirty-six percent of those exposed and 37% of those unexposed to anticoagulants reported that they would select a medication that has an antidote even if the risk of bleeding was very small. Twenty-three percent of the unexposed and 22% of the exposed groups reported that they would prefer the medication that gives the best quality of life. Conclusion: Our study found that patients who may be exposed to an anticoagulation decision prefer to actively participate in the decision-making process, and have individual values for making a decision that cannot be predicted or assumed by anyone in the health care system. © 2015 Palacio et al.",Palacio A.M.; Kirolos I.; Tamariz L.,Out of scope,10.2147/PPA.S64295,Atrial fibrillation; Bleeding risk; Medication selection; Oral anticoagulant; Patient decision making; Warfarin,,0.0,0,100,Dove Medical Press Ltd.,"The abstract discusses patient preferences regarding anticoagulant choices in a healthcare context, which does not relate to marketing.",scopus-recommendation,0,0,Patient values and preferences when choosing anticoagulants,2015
"Issues of segmentation and positioning have always been at the heart of marketing management. In recent years, much methodological progress has been made in order to carry out these two tasks simultaneously, that is, to combine certain types of clustering algorithms with appropriate multidimensional scaling or unfolding procedures. When trying to provide managers with a tool to support marketing decision-making in segmentation and positioning, the ease of use and the visual quality of results must be emphasized. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of alternative graphical formats designed to assist strategic management. It focuses on three aspects, namely, (I) representing competitive market structures, (II) illustrating preferences for product attributes, and (III) describing customer heterogeneity at the individual as well as segment-specific levels; this paper also explores the interrelations among these aspects.

"The main purpose of the research is to study the key success factors for obtaining a One Tambon One Product (OTOP) food five-star rating, in terms of the characteristics of the community enterprise: management, marketing, production, product development, financial management and agency support. Data was collected from both the presidents and the customers of community enterprises in Phatthalung and Songkhla provinces whose products were selected as five-star food products of the OTOP project in 2011. In-depth interviews were used to collect data from 13 presidents of community enterprises. For consumers, 260 consumers (a group of 20 customers from each community enterprise) were selected to be the sample, and data was collected by both interview and questionnaire. Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data while means, standard deviation and percentage were used to analyse the quantitative data. In terms of management functions, most of the entrepreneurs carry out all management functions: planning, organizing, leading and controlling. On planning, the majority of the managers do all the planning for the enterprise. On organization, all responsibilities are divided between the staff according to their rates of pay. The president of the community enterprise leads the business. Morale has been built up to motivate the staff, and conflict has been eliminated within the operation. Monitoring the activities of the members, and training given by the organization itself or by a third party, were used as part of the controlling function. In terms of marketing, the majority of entrepreneurs focused on a marketing plan for distribution and promotion. They paid great attention to the quality of the product, and the price was set by considering relevant factors. Customers were attracted by various means, and the products were distributed at a place which was convenient for consumers to access. Sales promotions and advertising were used for the promotion mix. Competitors also sell similar products. In terms of production, the entrepreneurs used local raw materials from local or nearby suppliers under long-term contracts. Products were produced on demand using standard technology along with labour. Product quantity was fixed with the customer order. Most products were certified by the food agency. In order to enhance customer choice, most entrepreneurs have developed new products. In term of finances, most of the entrepreneurs have a financial plan in which the initial finance came from the owner or the president of the group. Working capital was allocated and the account was managed. Dividends were shared between all members, and the businesses have no outstanding debt. In terms of support, most of the enterprises were supported by government agencies, and only one enterprise was supported by a private agency. The main problems of production were the uncertainty of nature, the inadequacy of raw materials, delays in production during high season, the product reaching its expiry date, and a shortage of labour. The results from consumers indicated that the taste and cleanliness of the product were the factors that impact on their buying decision when the purpose of buying was to consume the product oneself. More than fifty per cent of customers bought the products more than twice. The purchasing motivation was the consumption of the product. The level of product satisfaction of the consumers was very high, while the levels of satisfaction with price, place and promotion were high. The recommendations are that the community enterprise should have 1) explicit planning of its operation, 2) a clear organization and allocation of responsibilities, 3) short and long term planning, 4) an emphasis on product development, 5) effective production planning, and 6) systematic accounting. Moreover, 7) the government should have a policy which practically supports the OTOP entrepreneurs.",Noknoi C.; Boripunt W.; Lungtae S.,Tactical,,,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the implementation of specific strategies in community enterprises to achieve a five-star rating for OTOP food products.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceived brand orientation (PBO), satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour in the Australian higher education sector. Design/methodology/approach – Two hundred and fifty-eight questionnaires were completed by undergraduate students of a particular university in Australia. Structural equation modeling was employed in this study to examine the associations between the constructs. Findings – This study provides empirical evidence that PBO has a positive and significant relationship with all dependent variables. The research reveals that students' perception of a university's brand orientation is significantly related to satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The findings may guide the key decision makers in higher education institutions to understand the importance of brand orientation in their corporate strategy to enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and positive WOM, which can be used to differentiate themselves from other institutions in the highly competitive education market. Originality/value – Past researchers have not looked into the dynamic relationships between PBO, satisfaction, loyalty, and post-enrolment communication behaviour, and hence research is to be called for in this area. The paper is the first to examine brand orientation from the perspective of the students and provide higher education institutions with recommendations to improve service quality through brand orientation. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Casidy R.,Strategic,10.1108/APJML-06-2013-0069,Brand orientation; Customer loyalty; Customer satisfaction; Higher education; Structural equation modelling; Word-of-mouth marketing,5.0,,10,5,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The study examines the long-term implications of brand orientation in higher education, focusing on enhancing satisfaction and loyalty, which are strategic goals for institutions.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,The role of brand orientation in the higher education sector: a student-perceived paradigm,2013
"This paper aims to explore the opportunities that online marketing has to offer and contribute towards small independent hotels in view of the recent decline in hotel brand loyalty. This decline has been fuelled by consumer trends for ‘getting their money’s worth’ and the ability for the small or medium-sized hospitality establishments to reach consumers via Web Based Marketing Strategies. This has narrowed the competition gap with larger international hotel chains considerably. The paper includes a study which identifies the features of hotel websites that are essential to the building and structure of an effective hotel website. The six key elements identified in this paper are accessibility, information, credibility, e-commerce, customer relationship and immediacy. The reliability and validity of this six-element framework as a reflection of user requirements was ‘derived’ and established using empirical data from a survey. These six elements are established factors in granting online customer satisfaction and gaining customer loyalty. An important or crucial sector covered by this study is the Guest User Interface (GUI) of websites (accessibility). It has proven to be evident that attractive, easy to use or a user friendly interface is vital to keep consumers on the site without navigating them to another site long enough to make decisions. The conclusion of this paper is that independent hotels must leverage this opportunity by establishing a strong Web presence and capitalize on other sideline recommendations which include collaborations with third-party booking sites (such as Hotels.com) and developing informative, feature-rich websites of their own. © Mohamed Nassar, Sherif Hassan Abdou, 2013.",Nassar M.; Abdou S.H.,Tactical,,Branding; Hotels; Replicated model; Websites,5.0,,15,0,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,"The abstract discusses specific strategies and elements that independent hotels can implement to improve their online marketing presence and customer engagement, which aligns with tactical decision-making.

"Previous research has found that the country and institution choices of international students are greatly influenced by recommendations they receive from others who have experience of undertaking higher education overseas. For Western universities, it is of utmost importance to satisfy their international students, who can then encourage the next generation of international students to attend those same institutions. However, student satisfaction is not the only factor at play. Using a framework of 'push and pull' factors, rooted in the international student choice literature, this exploratory study investigates the determinants of destination choice of international students who decided to study at a university in the UK and examines their attitudes toward international branch campuses. The survey results and analyses suggest that overseas campuses could pose a considerable threat to home campuses in the competition for international students in the future. ©2011 Taylor & Francis.",Wilkins S.; Huisman J.,Strategic,10.1080/08841241.2011.573592,Competition; Higher education marketing; International branch campuses; Student choice; Student recruitment,5.0,,10,0,,"The abstract discusses the long-term influences on international student choices and satisfaction, which relate to strategic goals for universities competing for international students.

"Sunk costs, which can cause inconsistencies between consumer behavior and economic theory, have been widely studied in different research areas and among various consumer groups. Nevertheless, the authors found that to date there has been no empirical research examining how sunk costs affect consumer behavior with regard to online shopping in different product types. Therefore, this study used the following 2 × 2 × 2 experimental design to study the effects of sunk costs on consumers' online shopping decisions. The results show that (1) sunk costs have significant effects on consumer online shopping behavior. However, due to the different product characteristics, the impacts were weaker effective when consumers bought search goods than when they purchased experience goods; (2) the sunk costs (Membership fee vs. Deposit) of an initial choice and a new choice had interaction effects on consumer intention to purchase a new product; and (3) the sunk costs and service quality of an initial choice and new choice would affect the level of regret felt with regard to the consumer's initial choice. In addition, some recommendations on market positioning and service quality design are made, which practitioners can refer to when formulating marketing strategies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose: Although there is evidence that adoption of mobile shopping has been slow, the increased functionality offered by smart phones offers significant potential for the development of marketing and retailing through the mobile channel. The purpose of this paper is to add to knowledge on consumer shopping behaviour through mobile devices by exploring attitudes to the use of mobiles in shopping, the use of mobile phones at different stages in the consumer decision-making process, the impact of involvement on the mobile consumer decision-making process and mobile shopping location. Design/methodology/approach: An online panel survey was conducted with a UK panel of nationally representative consumers. The survey collected data in respect of the following products that were ranked on level of involvement on the basis of the importance and effort consumers' associated with their purchase: bread (lowest), washing powder, DVD, footwear, phone and TV (highest). Findings: Use of mobiles for shopping is significant, but remains lower than use of computers in shopping. In general, respondents were more positive regarding their use of computer shopping than they were in relation to their use of a mobile. In using their mobile phone in shopping, respondents value its convenience and accessibility. There is higher use of the mobile phone in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases, than in the purchase transaction. The extent of use of mobile devices in the decision-making process is higher with higher involvement products, in relation to all stages in the decision-making process. The most frequent location for the use of their mobile in shopping is at home, which is consistent with the finding that the highest level of use of mobiles occurs in the information search and consideration of alternatives phases. Recommendations are offered for retailers and for further research.

"There is mounting evidence that current food production, transport, land use and urban design negatively impact both climate change and obesity outcomes. Recommendations to prevent climate change provide an opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and alter our food and physical activity environments in favour of a 'healthier' energy balance. Hence, setting goals to achieve a more sustainable society offers a unique opportunity to reduce levels of obesity. In the case of children, this approach is supported with evidence that even from a young age they show emerging understandings of complex environmental issues and are capable of both internalizing positive environmental values and influencing their own environmental outcomes. Given young children's high levels of environmental awareness, it is easy to see how environmental sustainability messages may help educate and motivate children to make 'healthier' choices. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a new approach to tackling childhood obesity by tapping into existing social movements, such as environmental sustainability, in order to increase children's motivation for healthy eating and physical activity behaviours and thus foster more wholesome communities. We contend that a social marketing framework may be a particularly useful tool to foster behaviour change beneficial to both personal and environmental health by increasing perceived benefits and reducing perceived costs of behaviour change. Consequently, we propose a new framework which highlights suggested pathways for helping children initiate and sustain 'healthier' behaviours in order to inform future research and potentially childhood obesity intervention strategies. © The Author (2013).",Skouteris H.; Cox R.; Huang T.; Rutherford L.; Edwards S.; Cutter-Mackenzie A.,Strategic,10.1093/heapro/dat007,Children; Environmental sustainability; Obesity prevention; Social marketing,5.0,,10,5,Oxford University Press,"The abstract discusses a long-term approach to addressing childhood obesity by integrating environmental sustainability into health behaviors, which aligns with strategic planning and goal-setting for societal change.",scopus-recommendation,70,10,Promoting obesity prevention together with environmental sustainability,2014

"Recent literature about broadband telecommunications reveals two major areas that are not only globally gaining prominence, but are also demanding urgent attention from a research perspective. One of the key areas is related to the need to spatially evaluate the availability and deployment of broadband services, especially among urban versus rural communities. Another area of interest falls under the need for enabling broadband policies and strategies that address existing geographic disparities. These motivating factors shaped this research and provided a basis for defining three specific objectives, namely: (1) to identify locations with or without broadband access, (2) to identify underserved rural and inner-city markets, and (3) to determine whether university and community college towns can be used in the adoption and dispersion of broadband technologies in southern Illinois. Supply-side and demand-side data were collected and inputted into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Supply-side data included cable modem, digital subscriber lines (DSL), wireless, and fiber optic lines, while demand data included reported broadband requests from individuals without access (n = 439), students (n = 45,866), and higher education workforce (n = 5419). Using the GIS and statistical techniques, insightful maps of broadband infrastructure were created to illustrate areas of supply and demand so that governments and businesses can address existing gaps in consumer needs. Specifically, different levels of broadband access and use were mapped; different under-served rural and inner-city markets were identified so as to emphasize the dramatic economic impact on the business opportunities available to small business entrepreneurs. Also, different geographies of use and accessibility of broadband connectivity in the study region were synthesized to support decision-making. The resulting maps provided supply and demand marketing intelligence based on the geographic analyses of residential and enterprise sectors. These data can be used as a model to develop specific policy recommendations for a knowledge-based economy, specifically for the southern Illinois region or other rural communities in the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Oyana T.J.,Strategic,10.1016/j.giq.2010.09.003,Broadband; Digital divide; GIS; ICT; Spatial analysis,5.0,,5,0,,"The abstract focuses on identifying and addressing geographic disparities in broadband access and formulating policies to improve broadband deployment, which aligns with long-term planning and goal setting.",scopus-recommendation,70,20,Exploring geographic disparities in broadband access and use in rural southern Illinois: Who's being left behind?,2011
"Assessing the value of marketing to a business remains a thorny issue in theory and practice. Decision-making at the finance-marketing interface is under-researched, particularly for project businesses. Confronted by demands of accountability concerning the allocation of resources to meet competitive pressures, the paper examines the quality and extent of dialogue in investment decision-making. The return on investment (ROI) and marketing-specific investment (ROMI) are important factors at the marketing-finance interface. ROMI/ROI is examined from quantitative and qualitative viewpoints. The empirical evidence shows that short-term financial criteria dominate and are misaligned to long-term performance of project businesses and business units. Marketing investment in relation to project markets poses a particularly challenging environment. Client lifetime value and programme data sets for ROMI coupled with qualitative decision-making offer ways forward with constructive dialogue at the finance-marketing interface.

"From the supplier firm's perspective, a referral is a recommendation from A (the referrer) to B (the potential customer) that B should, or should not, purchase from C (the supplier firm). Thus, as referrals are for a specific supplier firm, they should be viewed as part of the supplier firm's marketing and sales activities. We recognize three types of referrals - customer-to-potential customer referrals, horizontal referrals, and supplier-initiated referrals - that have critical roles in a potential customer's purchase decision.We develop the concept of referral equity to capture the net effect of all referrals for a supplier firm in the market. We argue that supplier firms should view referral equity as a resource that has financial value to the firm as it affects the firm's cash flows and profits. We offer strategies firms can use to manage referrals and build their referral equity and suggest a research agenda.

"Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate consumer reactions to professionals who use decision aids to make recommendations. The authors propose that people react negatively to decision aids only when they are usedin place ofhuman expert judgment. When used in combination with expert judgment, decision aids are not perceived negatively and may even enhance service evaluations. Design/methodology/approach – Three online experiments are presented. Participants indicated their perceptions regarding the recommendation strategy of professionals and their impressions of these professionals using one of three strategies: one based on expertise only, one based on decision aids only and a combination of the two (hybrid approach). Both within and between-subjects designs were used. Findings – Contrary to previous research that has found a negative reaction to professionals who use decision aids, the authors fnd that consumers actually appreciate these professionals, as long as the use of decision aids does not replace expert judgment. The authors also fnd that when people are given the opportunity to compare a pure expert judgment approach with a hybrid approach (decision aid in combination with expert judgment), they prefer the latter. Research limitations/implications – Although fndings should extend to various contexts, this research is limited to the three contexts examined and to the type of use of decision aid described. Practical implications – It has signifcant practical implication,as decision aids have been shown to improve decision accuracy, but previous research had indicated that consumers view these professionals in a negative way. The current research more clearly delineates the situations under which negative reactions are likely to occur and makes recommendations regarding circumstances in which reactions are actually quite positive.

"Electronic recommendation agents provide a way for online marketers to gather information about consumer preferences and assess the quality of consumer decisions. Much of the literature on recommendation agents, however, employs divergent measures to assess consumer decision quality. Moreover, decision quality measures are dictated by the type of agent employed. This article provides a review of the decision quality measures used in the recommendation agent research to date and proposes novel measures. We classify and examine the assumptions of-and relationships among-preference-dependent, preference-independent, and subjective measures of decision quality. The analysis of data from an experiment that simulates a broad spectrum of recommendation agents shows that the relative utility and the sum of attribute values of the chosen alternative capture the majority of variance in objective decision quality. Although subjective decision quality measures turn out to be poor proxies for objective measures, they provide important incremental information.

"Because hedonic products consist predominantly of experience attributes, often with many available alternatives, choosing the ""right"" one is a demanding task for consumers. Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Hennig-Thurau T.; Marchand A.; Marx P.,Tactical,10.1509/jm.10.0537,Agents; Group decisions; Hedonic products; Joint consumption; Recommender systems; Social relationship quality,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the implementation and effects of group recommender systems, which are tactical in nature as they interpret strategic goals (improving consumer decision-making) into structured decision-making processes for specific use cases, such as choosing hedonic products.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,Can automated group recommender systems help consumers make better choices?,2012
"This study investigates the contribution of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to the sales of music albums. We conducted an empirical investigation of twenty-two music albums for a period of eleven consecutive weeks. eWOM was identified as an uncertainty-reducing element in consumer decision-making. Generally, the research hypotheses were partially supported using a multivariate linear regression model. We also found a stronger correlation between some eWOM channels and sales compared to other channels. eWOM has traditionally been considered an un-structured and ad-hoc source of sentiment. Our results suggest that eWOM generated in social networking when analysed appropriately is a fairly reliable predictor of market success. It is effective as a tacit suggestion, recommendation, or referral element with viral network effects.

"There has been no significant research undertaken in the Japanese market on wine knowledge level and its relationship with brand loyalty and preference for specific country-of-origin (COO) wine brands. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these aspects and how wine knowledge is acquired and used in buying decisions. A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language was used to collect data over a three-week period. Data include consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. The sample population was female-weighted with moderate levels of education and medium income. A ten-item objective wine knowledge scale was developed to measure consumers' knowledge levels and to form the basis for segmentation. Japanese wine consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge were shown to use more intrinsic cues than extrinsic cues in their purchase decisions, with the importance attributed to intrinsic cues increasing as objective knowledge increases. The study showed consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge do not use the COO cue more than consumers with lower knowledge. Wine consumers view taste, variety and price as the most important buying cues and are influenced by the recommendations of people around them. This research provided insights into the Japanese wine market and the nature of the Japanese wine consumer. It is recommended that wine exporters focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including greater wine education. This study is of value to academic researchers, wine educators, industry practitioners such as restaurant owners/sommeliers and wine exporters alike, as it provides insights into the direction and extent of COO preferences and hence wine (country) brand loyalty. It has a specific focus on wine knowledge and the educational aspect thereof highlighting how this can be used for the benefit of stakeholders. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Bruwer J.; Buller C.,Tactical,10.1108/10610421211253605,Brand loyalty; Brand preference; Consumer behaviour; Country of origin; Japan; Market segmentation; Objective knowledge; Subjective knowledge; Wines,5.0,,15,0,,"The study provides insights into consumer behavior and preferences in the Japanese wine market, suggesting targeted marketing and educational efforts, which are tactical decisions that can be implemented to achieve strategic goals.",scopus-recommendation,20,60,Country-of-origin (COO) brand preferences and associated knowledge levels of Japanese wine consumers,2012
"Experiments are a well-suited method for empirically studying cause-and-effect relationships. This article provides a guideline for designing experiments. We develop an integrative framework that illustrates the key decisions in designing experimental studies. With this framework, we discuss important problem areas in the design of experiments (e.g., determining the experimental setting, choosing participants). Finally, for the different decisions and identified problem areas, we derive concrete recommendations for designing experimental studies in marketing research. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Koschate-Fischer N.; Schandelmeier S.,Tactical,10.1007/s11573-014-0708-6,Cause-and-effect relationships; Experimental research,5.0,,15,0,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,"The abstract discusses the design of experiments in marketing research, focusing on specific decisions and recommendations, which aligns with tactical decision-making processes that interpret strategic goals into structured actions.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,A guideline for designing experimental studies in marketing research and a critical discussion of selected problem areas,2014
"Link structures among items within an E-commerce Web site can be regarded as a potential recommendation that helps new consumers quickly locate relevant products. In this paper, combining a modified version of Googles PageRank method with economic analysis of word of mouth, we investigate whether a products position within a network composed of recommendation links is incrementally informative about its future sales. Based on data from Amazon.com, we document that with consumer word of mouth and other product characteristics controlled, the position of a product within a recommendation network does influence consumers purchase decisions, and models incorporating link structure have a higher incremental predictive power of future sales than models without. In addition, as time elapses, the relative weights consumers placed on recommendations with price discount and those without are different. Last, we develop a learning mechanism through which we find the optimal damping value of the PageRank IR model in the Amazon context. Our results show that compared to general Internet surfing behavior, consumer consumption on Amazon is less random. We conclude that even though the product position within a recommendation network does influence customers purchase behaviors, product sales are still mainly driven by their own product characteristics. © 2012 IEEE.",Hu N.; Tian G.; Liu L.; Liang B.; Gao Y.,Tactical,10.1109/TEM.2010.2064318,Collaborative-filtering cross sale; marketing strategy; online word of mouth (WOM); PageRank; price strategy,5.0,,15,0,,"The abstract discusses the impact of product positioning within a recommendation network on consumer purchase decisions, which aligns with tactical decision-making in marketing.

"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore how a change to a US policy about product testimonials affected bloggers and to understand bloggers’ perceptions of the organization-blogger relationship (OBR). Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes a survey (n=173) with closed and open-ended questions, and both quantitative and qualitative data are analyzed. Findings – Bloggers’ decisions to accept compensation for a review may influence how much control they feel they have over the OBR. Qualitative data indicate that even as bloggers seek access to products to review, they prefer to maintain editorial control over the review process. Research limitations/implications – The study extends the transparency literature in public relations and relationship management theory by exploring the relationship between bloggers and public relations professionals through the lens of a disclosure policy. Practical implications – Recommendations are offered for public relations professionals in how to maintain transparent relationships with bloggers. Social implications – Qualitative data reveal concern among bloggers about efforts to persuade them and what they should disclose; this may impact the trust that consumers have in reviews at blogs. Originality/value – The study demonstrates the effects of review behaviors on the OBR and offers an organic explanation of how this relationship evolves. This is important as consumers are increasingly consulting blogs for product information. This issue also has relevance to public relations professionals, who are encouraged to broach the issue of transparency with bloggers. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Walden J.; Bortree D.; DiStaso M.,Tactical,10.1108/JCOM-08-2013-0065,Communications; Electronic media; Ethics; Information media; Public relations; Relationship marketing,5.0,,15,0,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"The abstract discusses how bloggers perceive their relationship with organizations in the context of product testimonials, focusing on the implications of compensation and editorial control.

"Purpose - This chapter presents a framework useful in conducting multicountry marketing and advertising research. For the purpose of illustrating the series of steps involved in conducting such investigations, a six-country study examining global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) is presented. The suggested steps are relevant for the exploration of a wide variety of marketing- and advertising-related topics. Methodology/approach - Steps essential to a well-planned research design are addressed in detail, including: theory identification, stimuli selection, hypotheses formulation, measurement development, country selection, fictitious ad development, survey design, cross-national data equivalence, and hypotheses testing. Particular attention is given to construct specification (in this case for soft-sell and hard-sell advertising appeals) and fictitious ad development. General consumers in six countries responded to the ads. Specific procedures for validating formative constructs and testing their cross-country equivalency are suggested. Findings - The chapter provides practical recommendations for conducting cross-cultural research. These recommendations are likely to prove useful to both researchers conducting multicountry investigations, and to instructors teaching graduate-level courses in international marketing and advertising research. Originality/value of paper - Multicountry research requires a series of challenging decisions. Although a well-planned research design is particularly essential in a cross-cultural setting, little attention has been given in providing researchers and instructors with methodological recommendations. This chapter is intended to be a useful reference for these audiences. © 2011 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Okazaki S.; Mueller B.; Diehl S.,Tactical,10.1108/S1474-7979(2011)0000022007,Construct specification; Cross-country equivalency; Fictitious ad development; Global advertising strategy; Global consumer culture positioning; Multicountry research; Research framework; Soft-sell/hard-sell appeals; Validation of formative constructs,5.0,,15,0,,"The chapter provides a framework for conducting multicountry marketing and advertising research, detailing steps for research design, such as survey design and hypotheses testing, which are more structured and target-oriented activities consistent with tactical decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,70,A multicountry advertising research framework: Lessons learned from testing global consumer culture positioning,2011
"Purpose: Pharmaceutical companies' marketing strategies have traditionally targeted only physicians and, more recently, consumers. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the pharmacist as prescriber, influencer, switcher, and dispenser of pharmaceutical drugs in one developing country, Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed pharmacists in Cairo, Egypt. The pharmacists were asked to estimate the percentages of patients who came in with a prescription, with only a box or a recommendation for a medicine and with only symptoms, and whether he/she switched the patient to another medicine. Pharmacies were classified as to the social class of the pharmacy neighborhoods. Cluster analysis was used to further classify pharmacists as ""Influencers"" and ""Non-influencers"". Findings: Overall the pharmacists influence 39 percent of all purchase decisions for pharmaceuticals with higher levels of influence in lower social class neighborhoods. Approximately one out of four pharmacists was classified as an Influencer. Practical implications: In developing countries, the pharmacist plays a key role in which medicines patients ultimately purchase. Marketing activities directed toward the pharmacist may provide an important opportunity to maximize the pharmaceutical firms' return on marketing investment. Originality/value: Few studies have looked at the marketing of pharmaceutical drugs in developing countries. This paper is unique in that it examines the role of the pharmacist in these markets, thus providing an important addition to the understanding of the challenges to the industry in these countries and important implications for pharmaceutical marketing strategies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Taher A.; Stuart E.W.; Hegazy I.,Strategic,10.1108/17506121211243068,Developing countries; Egypt; Expert power; Influence; Marketing strategy; Pharmaceutical marketing; Pharmaceutical products; Pharmacists,5.0,,10,5,,"The paper explores the role of pharmacists in pharmaceutical marketing strategies in a developing country, indicating long-term implications for the industry and marketing efforts.",scopus-recommendation,60,20,The pharmacist's role in the Egyptian pharmaceutical market,2012
