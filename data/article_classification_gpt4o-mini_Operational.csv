"Some businesses on product development prefer to use a chatbot for judging the customer's view. Today, the ability of a chatbot to consider the context is challenging due to its technical nature. Sometimes, it may misjudge the context, making the wrong decision in predicting the product's originality in the market. This task of chatbot helps the enterprise make huge profits from accurate predictions. However, chatbots may commit errors in dialogs and bring inappropriate responses to users, reducing the confidentiality of product and marketing information. This, in turn, reduces the enterprise gain and imposes cost complications on businesses. To improve the performance of chatbots, AI models are used based on deep learning concepts. This research proposes a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model for addressing the logical and fuzzy errors caused by retrieval chatbot models. This model cuts down on the error raised from the information loss. Our experiments extensively trained the model on a large Ubuntu dialog corpus. The recall evaluation scores showed that the MH-DNN approach slightly outperformed selected state-of-the-art retrieval-based chatbot approaches. The results obtained from the MHDNN augmentation approach were pretty impressive. In our proposed work, the MHDNN algorithm exhibited accuracy rates of 94% and 92%, respectively, with and without the help of the Seq2Seq technique. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Zheng S.; Yahya Z.; Wang L.; Zhang R.; Hoshyar A.N.,Operational,10.1016/j.ipm.2023.103446,Artificial intelligence; Business product development; Chatbot; Deep neural network; Marketing,5.0,,65,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses the implementation of a multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN) model to improve the performance of chatbots, which are primarily focused on managing day-to-day consumer interactions and decision-making processes.

"The proliferation and increasing significance of AI-enabled voice assistants (AIVAs) for consumer purchase decisions imply the need for a better understanding of their acceptance in the higher education (HE) enrollment context. Using the Grounded Theory (GT) research method and a consumer value perspective, we examine the enrolment decision-making of international students in the presence of AIVAs to propose a conceptual model linking value to adoption. Findings highlight the influence of the key antecedents of hedonic and functional value in AIVA adoption. The findings also indicate that the student and the AIVA can co-create novel experiences during information search and evaluation of enrollment alternatives. Some participants proactively suggest a larger role for the AIVA to aid their enrollment decision-making.

"Consumers are widely adopting Artificially Intelligent Voice Assistants (AIVAs). AIVAs now handle many different everyday tasks and are also increasingly assisting consumers with purchasing decisions, making AIVAs a rich topic for marketing researchers. We develop a series of propositions regarding how consumer decision-making processes may change when moved from traditional online purchase environments to AI-powered voice-based dialogs, in the hopes of encouraging further academic thinking and research in this rapidly developing, high impact area of consumer-firm interaction. We also provide suggestions for marketing managers and policymakers on points to pay attention to when they respond to the proposed effects of AIVAs on consumer decisions. © 2020, The Author(s).",Dellaert B.G.C.; Shu S.B.; Arentze T.A.; Baker T.; Diehl K.; Donkers B.; Fast N.J.; Häubl G.; Johnson H.; Karmarkar U.R.; Oppewal H.; Schmitt B.H.; Schroeder J.; Spiller S.A.; Steffel M.,Operational,10.1007/s11002-020-09537-5,Artificial intelligence; Consumer decision-making; Consumer dialogs; Consumer models; Digital marketing; Voice assistants,5.0,,65,5,Springer,"The abstract discusses how Artificially Intelligent Voice Assistants (AIVAs) impact consumer decision-making processes, which aligns closely with the management of day-to-day consumer interactions and preferences.

"Many firms rely on choice experiment-based models to evaluate future marketing actions under various market conditions. This research investigates choice complexity (i.e., number of alternatives, number of attributes, and utility similarity between the most attractive alternatives) and individual differences in decision time as key factors that affect the predictive performance of models based on choice experiments, both within and between complexity conditions. The results show that complexity and individual decision time not only affect the error in consumer choice models but also consumers' decision strategy and systematic utilities. The authors introduce a complexity-adjusted mixed logit (CAM logit) model to capture the various influences of complexity in choice experiment-based models. They illustrate the consequences of complexity on choice behavior with market share predictions of the CAM logit model for different complexity conditions. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Dellaert B.G.C.; Donkers B.; Van Soest A.,Operational,10.1509/jmr.09.0315,Choice complexity; Choice experiments; Choice model predictive performance; Choice models; Decision time,5.0,,60,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses choice experiment-based models and their predictive performance, focusing on decision time and complexity, which relates to day-to-day marketing activities and consumer decision-making processes.",scopus-prediction,10,25,Complexity effects in choice experiment-based models,2012
"The power that default options have in shaping choice has been well established, yet relatively little is known about how decision makers experience and interpret such preselected options. Research suggests that individuals assume defaults represent a recommended course of action, yet the basis for this recommendation is unclear. Across two experimental studies, we explored consumer theories of default recommendations, examining spontaneous and experimentally manipulated perceptions of the basis of the default, and the impact on decision making across different contexts. Evidence across diverse populations and tasks shows that options were retained to a greater extent when represented as the default, consistent with classic default effects. Furthermore, a significant default effect emerged when the decision context was framed as complex. In line with research on social influence, defaults were most effective when they were presumed to reflect the most popular option (regardless of context). Interestingly, participants rated defaults as being more likely to represent the most popular option, regardless of decision context or default explanation provided to them. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the contexts in which default choices are relied upon and how those defaults are perceived by decision makers. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Buchanan T.M.; Buchanan J.; Diedericks D.; Davis L.,Operational,10.1111/ijcs.12847,decision making; default; nudge; perceptions; social psychology,5.0,,60,5,John Wiley and Sons Inc,"The study focuses on how default options influence consumer decision-making, which relates to managing consumer preferences and choices, indicative of operational decision-making.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,I'll have what she's having: (Social) Perceptions of default options and implications for marketing and decision making,2023
"Multiple criteria approaches can assist the product manager to know the consumer preferences in the context of e-commerce. Consumer preference analysis explains what aspects of a product affect and how they affect a consumer's purchasing decision. This issue plays an important role in e-commerce platforms from its relevance in marketing decisions such as advertisements, recommendations and promotions. In this regard, we propose a data-driven multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach to integrate online information, such as explicit (e.g., reviews and ratings) and implicit (e.g., clicks and purchases) feedback from consumers. However, MCDA approaches present a critical challenge that even an experienced product manager could find it difficult to pre-define the criteria on which a product is evaluated. To address this issue, our proposed approach first utilizes text-mining techniques to assist the product manager identify the criteria, and then determines and collects the relative importance of the criteria and their values. Given the criteria information, we use a sampling process to provide two indices, the consumer preference index and rank acceptability index. The first index helps in prioritizing the pairwise comparisons of products, while the second one helps in deriving a default ranking list for first-time-registered consumers. We record the products viewed by consumers and generate their preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons for analyses within an aggregation-disaggregation paradigm. We also provide a representative value function to help the product manager gain insight into the preferences. Finally, we describe how a real-world application including the product manager and consumers exploits the proposed approach on an e-commerce platform to take a large step toward aiding more realistic and data-driven multiple criteria decision making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Guo M.; Liao X.; Liu J.; Zhang Q.,Operational,10.1016/j.omega.2019.05.010,E-commerce; Multiple criteria decision making; Online reviews; Preference analysis; Preference modeling,10.0,,60,0,Elsevier Ltd,The abstract describes a data-driven approach to assist product managers in understanding consumer preferences using multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) methods.

"The role of virtual salesperson (VS) and the importance of customer reviews in facilitating online purchase decisions and sales have recently received much attention from technology companies, marketing practice professionals, and academics. However, customers’ willingness to follow the purchase advice of the VS when there is a conflict between these recommendations and those of other online customers is less understood. This research theorizes and investigates the extent to which customers’ relationship satisfaction with, and trust in, the VS helps explain customer willingness to follow VS advice in the context of recommendation conflict. Using four studies, our research explores how and when the VS’s avatar design mitigates the negative influence of conflict. An important theoretical and managerial implication of this research is that VS avatar designs that are high in automated social presence (ASP) help reduce the negative impact of conflict. However, we find that ASP mitigates the negative effects of conflict only for avatars that score low (vs. high) on cuteness. © The Author(s) 2020.",Lin Y.-T.; Doong H.-S.; Eisingerich A.B.,Operational,10.1177/1094670520964872,avatar design; cuteness; relationship satisfaction; social presence; trust,5.0,,70,0,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses the role of virtual salespersons and how their design influences customer decision-making related to online purchases.

"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from highfamiliarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Guo F.; Zhang X.; Ding Y.; Wang X.,Operational,10.1037/npe0000051,Event-related potentials; Neural responses; Propensity; Recommendation; Value measurement,10.0,,60,0,American Psychological Association Inc.,"The study focuses on the cognitive processes involved in consumer behavior and recommendations during online shopping, which aligns closely with day-to-day operational decisions and managing consumer interactions.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,Recommendation influence: Differential neural responses of consumers during shopping online,2016
"Many manufacturers are today striving to offer a large number of value-added PSSs (Product-Service Systems). The increased number of PSS hinders potential buyers from effectively discovering the most suitable PSS to satisfy their personalized requirements. To accurately find the needed or wanted PSS with lower search costs, it is effective to recommend suitable PSS solutions to the right buyers. However, service, a component of PSS, brings more subjective and imprecise information in acquiring users' preferences due to e.g. their different experience and knowledge on services. Moreover, the interactions within user's preferences are often omitted in previous methods, which may lead to inaccurate recommendation results. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative method for PSS recommendation is developed. This method explicitly takes into account the environmental aspect of PSSs in question so that a method user can be guided to select an environmentally superior alternative. In addition, rough DEMATEL (Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) is proposed to manipulate the interactions of vague user preferences in multi-criteria weight determination. Furthermore, a rough collaborative filtering approach is developed to make PSS recommendation under vague environment. A case study of elevator PSS recommendation shows the feasibility and potentials of the proposed approach. Theoretically, the new method can produce more reasonable PSS recommendation results by considering the interdependencies between different recommendation criteria. In marketing practice, the method can suggest proposals of new offerings to customers in a proactive manner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Song W.; Sakao T.,Operational,10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.092,DEMATEL; Personalization; Product-Service System; Recommendation; Search cost,5.0,,60,5,Elsevier Ltd,"The abstract discusses a method for recommending Product-Service Systems (PSS) to users based on their preferences, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer decisions and recommendations online.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,An environmentally conscious PSS recommendation method based on users' vague ratings: A rough multi-criteria approach,2018
"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance- recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer-transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in ""choice mode."" Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",Dellaert B.G.C.; Häubl G.,Operational,10.1509/jmr.09.0481,Behavioral search models; Consumer decision making; Product recommendations; Product search,10.0,,65,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses how recommendations in product search influence consumer decision-making processes, which aligns closely with day-to-day activities and consumer behavior management, typical of operational decisions.",scopus-recommendation,10,15,Searching in choice mode: Consumer decision processes in product search with recommendations,2012
"The authors designed and ran an experiment to measure social influence in online recommender systems, specifically, how often people's choices are changed by others' recommendations when facing different levels of confirmation and conformity pressures. In this experiment, participants were first asked to provide their preference from pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of other people's preferences. The results show that other people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) rather than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, whereas demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",Zhu H.; Huberman B.A.,Operational,10.1177/0002764214527089,conformity theory; social influence; social media and choices,5.0,,60,5,SAGE Publications Inc.,"The abstract discusses an experiment that measures how social influence affects consumer choices in online recommender systems, which aligns with managing day-to-day consumer decision-making activities.",scopus-recommendation,10,20,To Switch or Not To Switch: Understanding Social Influence in Online Choices,2014
"Electronic recommendation agents provide a way for online marketers to gather information about consumer preferences and assess the quality of consumer decisions. Much of the literature on recommendation agents, however, employs divergent measures to assess consumer decision quality. Moreover, decision quality measures are dictated by the type of agent employed. This article provides a review of the decision quality measures used in the recommendation agent research to date and proposes novel measures. We classify and examine the assumptions of-and relationships among-preference-dependent, preference-independent, and subjective measures of decision quality. The analysis of data from an experiment that simulates a broad spectrum of recommendation agents shows that the relative utility and the sum of attribute values of the chosen alternative capture the majority of variance in objective decision quality. Although subjective decision quality measures turn out to be poor proxies for objective measures, they provide important incremental information.

"This research examines the influence of recommendations on consumer decision making during online shopping experiences. Evidence from two empirical studies suggests that many online consumers seek and accept recommendations in order to effectively manage the amount of information available during online search processes. These findings suggest that consumers use the mere availability of peer recommendations as a decision-making heuristic, irrespective of the peer recommender's personal characteristics. Findings also suggest that consumer preference for peer versus editorial recommendations depends on the specific nature of the consumer's shopping goal: utilitarian or hedonic Finally, results from this study indicate that consumers prefer peer and editorial recommendations over other types of effort-reducing cues that might be available during online search. As such, retailers must consider a number of factors including recommender characteristics, shopping goals, and product characteristics in their bid to provide consumers with the appropriate type of recommendation for their respective decision-making task. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.",Smith D.; Menon S.; Sivakumar K.,Operational,10.1002/dir.20041,,5.0,,65,5,Elsevier Inc.,"The abstract discusses consumer decision-making and the use of recommendations during online shopping, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer preferences and choices.

"Recommendations often play a positive role in the decision process by reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options. However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.",Fitzsimons G.J.; Lehmann D.R.,Operational,10.1287/mksc.1030.0033,Decision support systems; Intelligent agents; Internet marketing; Recommendations,5.0,,60,5,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract discusses consumer reactions to recommendations made by experts and intelligent agents, focusing on day-to-day decision-making processes and the unintended consequences of those recommendations.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of customer service, we define as a technology-enabled system for evaluating real-time service scenarios using data collected from digital and/or physical sources in order to pro-vide personalised recommendations, alternatives, and solutions to customers' enquiries or problems, even very complex ones . We examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred AI or Human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. The results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of AI to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use AI while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than AI. Moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers' service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for AI vs. Human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations are becoming increasingly prevalent, but consumers are often reluctant to trust them, in part due to the black-box nature of algorithm-facilitated recommendation agents. Despite the acknowledgment of the vital role of interpretability in consumer trust in AI recommendations, it remains unclear how to effectively increase interpretability perceptions and consequently enhance positive consumer responses. The current research addresses this issue by investigating the effects of the presence and type of post hoc explanations in boosting positive consumer responses to AI recommendations in different decision-making domains. Across four studies, the authors demonstrate that the presence of post hoc explanations increases interpretability perceptions, which in turn fosters positive consumer responses (e.g., trust, purchase intention, and click-through) to AI recommendations. Moreover, they show that the facilitating effect of post hoc explanations is stronger in the utilitarian (vs. hedonic) decision-making domain. Further, explanation type modulates the effectiveness of post hoc explanations such that attribute-based explanations are more effective in enhancing trust in the utilitarian decision-making domain, whereas user-based explanations are more effective in the hedonic decision-making domain.","Chen, CD; Tian, AD; Jiang, RC",Operational,10.1177/10949968231200221,AI recommendations; post hoc explanations; trust; consumer responses; interpretability perceptions; hedonic/utilitarian decision making,5.0,,60,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses how post hoc explanations in AI recommendations can enhance consumer trust and decision-making, which relates directly to the day-to-day operations of consumer interactions with AI systems.",wos-ai,10,25,When Post Hoc Explanation Knocks: Consumer Responses to Explainable AI Recommendations,2023

"The precision of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated information has been suggested in the past as a method of nudging consumers' evaluations and intentions, but little is known about whether such effects are also context-sensitive. Based on four studies, we find a matched condition under which consumers are more likely to make a positive response when precise (imprecise) numbers presented by AI recommenders are used in a utilitarian (hedonic) consumption context (Study 1). Additionally, we show that consumer conceptual fluency also mediates this matching effect on consumer purchase decision-making (Studies 2). We further show the matching effect is moderated by the recommender type (Study 3) and consumer lay beliefs about the AI and human recommenders (Study 4). This study shows that when consumers' lay belief changes from AI performs objective tasks well and Human performs subjective tasks well to AI performs subjective tasks well and Human performs objective tasks well, it can change the difference in the matching relationship between human and AI recommenders.","Zhu, H; Zhu, ZM; Ou, YL; Yin, Y",Operational,10.1002/mar.21904,AI adoption; artificial intelligence; conceptual fluency; hedonic product; preciseness; recommendation; utilitarian product,5.0,,65,5,WILEY,"The abstract discusses the impact of AI-generated information on consumer decision-making, particularly in the context of recommendations and consumer preferences, which aligns with day-to-day operational decisions.",wos-ai,10,15,To be precise (imprecise) in utilitarian (hedonic) contexts: Examining the influence of numerical precision on consumer reactions to artificial intelligence-based recommendations,2023

"Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel word-of-machine effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1-4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person's unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human-AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a-b).","Longoni, C; Cian, L",Operational,10.1177/0022242920957347,algorithms; artificial intelligence; augmented intelligence; hedonic and utilitarian consumption; recommendations; technology,5.0,,60,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses AI recommendations and consumer preferences, which are directly related to managing day-to-day activities in marketing and decision-making processes.

"The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as recommendation agents, presents new challenges and opportunities for marketing. Recommendation agents assist consumers in their online grocery shopping decisions by analyzing data on preferences and behaviors. This research highlights that while recommendation agents can reduce choice overload and make purchase decisions easier for consumers, they are also associated with higher uncertainty in decision-making. Three experimental studies confirmed that purchases aided by recommendation agents are perceived as more uncertain and reduced perceptions of control over the choices explain this outcome. Furthermore, lower choice satisfaction and purchase intentions are confirmed as consequences of perceived uncertainty. Personal characteristics such as risk aversion and maximization tendencies are considered boundary conditions for these effects.","Rohden, SF; Espartel, LB",Operational,10.1007/s10660-024-09808-7,Smart retailing; Artificial intelligence; Choice overload; Maximization tendencies; Risk perception,10.0,,60,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses the use of recommendation agents in online grocery shopping, focusing on day-to-day consumer decision-making and the management of choices influenced by AI technology.",wos-artificial intelligence,10,20,Consumer reactions to technology in retail: choice uncertainty and reduced perceived control in decisions assisted by recommendation agents,2024
"Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests.","Banker, S; Khetani, S",Operational,10.1177/0743915619858057,artificial intelligence; consumer decision making; decision aids; human-computer interaction; recommender systems,5.0,,65,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior in relation to recommender systems, focusing on how they make decisions based on algorithm-generated recommendations.

"This article investigates the consumer-voice assistant (VA) interaction in the context of food and beverage purchase choices and the role that psychological power plays in the consumer decision-making process. A series of experimental studies demonstrate that both involvement and the psychological condition of power meditate consumers' willingness to purchase. As a result, we find that consumers are more likely to purchase low involvement than high-involvement products through VA technology, particularly when experiencing high-power states. This study broadens our understanding of the role of VAs and their ability to shape the consumer decision-making process. With an explicit focus on power, this study illustrates how the success of voice commerce may largely rest on the promotion of low-involvement products that enable high-power psychological conditions which drive willingness to purchase.","Tassiello, V; Tillotson, JS; Rome, AS",Operational,10.1002/mar.21488,artificial intelligence; consumer decision‐ making process; food; involvement; psychological power; smart technologies; voice assistants,10.0,,60,0,WILEY,"The abstract focuses on consumer decisions with voice assistants in the context of food and beverage purchases, which relates closely to day-to-day activities of consumers.

"In this paper, we provide an axiomatic foundation for the value-based version of the drift diffusion model (DDM) of Ratcliff, a successful model that describes two-alternative speeded decisions between consumer goods. Our axioms present a test for model misspecification and connect the externally observable properties of choice with an important neurophysiologic account of how choice is internally implemented. We then extend our axiomatic analysis to multialternative choice under time pressure.

"The current research demonstrates how conversational robo advisors as opposed to static, non-conversational robo advisors alter perceptions of trust, the evaluation of a financial services firm, and consumer financial decision making. We develop and empirically test a novel conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology, showing that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced onboarding experience), but has important implications for investor behavior, such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors.

"This paper argues that choice modelling is a useful approach for all social sciences, while at the same time disciplines such as sociology and political science can contribute significantly to the future development of choice modelling. So far choice modelling has mainly been applied in disciplines that investigate types of consumption choices, be it marketing to investigate preferences for new products, transportation to analyse mode choices, or environmental economics to elicit preferences for public goods. However, using the information that can be gained from individual choices among mutually exclusive alternatives has gained increasing popularity in other disciplines as a powerful tool to test theoretical hypotheses and generate insights into individual behaviour. Examples are the acceptance of refugee shelters in peoples' neighbourhood, the choice of where to commit a crime or the evolution of social networks. A good point of departure for an expansion of choice modelling within the social sciences is the common foundation that many disciplines share that are gathered under the umbrella of social sciences. Research traditions and theoretical models include rational choice concepts, and choice modelling can be linked to crosscutting methods, including agent-based models, network analysis, and machine learning. At the same time, disciplines can complement each other in studying choice behaviour, as they can contribute concepts and tools less familiar to the other disciplines. Finally, all social science disciplines face challenges when it comes to issues such as causal analysis, heterogeneity in decision rules, joint decision making, or big data. Choice modelling and a cross-disciplinary dialogue can contribute to meeting these challenges.","Liebe, U; Meyerhoff, J",Operational,10.1016/j.jocm.2021.100270,Causal analysis; Context effects; Decision rules; Machine learning; Network analysis; Rational choice; Social sciences,5.0,,60,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the application of choice modeling as a precise tool for analyzing individual decisions and behaviors, which aligns closely with operational decision-making processes.

"The work considers modification of the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to the so-called System 1 (S1) approach. S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels happy, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data.","Lipovetsky, S",Operational,10.1080/23270012.2019.1702112,System 1; BWS; max diff; MNL utility; choice probability; prioritization,10.0,,60,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","The abstract discusses the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) and its modification to a System 1 approach, focusing on practical applications for data eliciting and analysis of prioritization among items.

"Chatbots can be used in marketing services to substantially improve the consumer experience. Based on cognitive appraisal theory, this study applied an event-related potential (ERP) approach to investigate consumers' emotional experiences and consumer trust in passive interaction with chatbots versus humans, taking into ac-count objective or subjective tasks in e-commerce. The results showed that chatbot (vs. human) service in-teractions automatically drew more consumer attention at the subconscious stage (i.e., a larger P2); consumers purposefully allocated more resources to regulate the negative emotions elicited by chatbots at the conscious stage (i.e., a larger LPP); and there was a lower trust in chatbots than in humans. Moreover, under subjective tasks, the differences between chatbots and human agents in emotional experience (as reflected by LPP) and trust were amplified. The findings will encourage e-retailers to improve the emotional service experience of their chatbots and prioritize the application of chatbots for objective tasks in customer service.","Wang, CC; Li, YY; Fu, WZ; Jin, J",Operational,10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103325,Chatbots; Emotional experience; Cognitive appraisal theory; Trust; Event-related potential,10.0,,60,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"The abstract discusses the emotional experiences and trust consumers have when interacting with chatbots compared to humans, which relates directly to managing the day-to-day activities of customer service through chatbots.

"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers' preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper's behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.","Lu, SS; Xiao, L; Ding, M",Operational,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,retailing; video analysis; collaborative filtering,10.0,,55,0,INFORMS,"The abstract describes an automated garment recommender system that focuses on day-to-day decision-making processes related to consumer preferences and recommendations, indicating a management of daily activities in the retail context.",wos-computer vision,10,25,A Video-Based Automated Recommender (VAR) System for Garments,2016
"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers' preference indicator.","Filipas, AM; Vretenar, N; Prudky, I",Operational,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,decision-making; consumers' preferences; data mining; decision trees; shopping behaviour indicators,5.0,,80,0,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS","The research focuses on understanding consumer preferences and behaviors related to online shopping, which involves precise decision-making about day-to-day consumer behavior and preferences.

"In this paper various ensemble learning methods from machine learning and statistics are considered and applied to the customer choice modeling problem. The application of ensemble learning usually improves the prediction quality of flexible models like decision trees and thus leads to improved predictions. We give experimental results for two real-life marketing datasets using decision trees, ensemble versions of decision trees and the logistic regression model, which is a standard approach for this problem. The ensemble models are found to improve upon individual decision trees and outperform logistic regression. Next, an additive decomposition of the prediction error of a model is considered known as the bias/variance decomposition. A model with a high bias lacks the flexibility to fit the data well. A high variance indicates that a model is instable with respect to different datasets. Decision trees have a high variance component and a low bias component in the prediction error, whereas logistic regression has a high bias component and a low variance component. It is shown that ensemble methods aim at minimizing the variance component in the prediction error while leaving the bias component unaltered. Bias/variance decompositions for all models for both customer choice datasets are given to illustrate these concepts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"We develop and test an active-machine-learning method to select questions adaptively when consumers use heuristic decision rules. The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a configurator. Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provide significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or bad priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when estimating heuristic decision rules. Heuristic decision rules predict validation decisions better than compensatory rules.","Dzyabura, D; Hauser, JR",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1110.0660,active learning; adaptive questions; belief propagation; conjunctive models; consideration sets; consumer heuristics; decision heuristics; disjunctions of conjunctions; lexicographic models; variational Bayes estimation,5.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract focuses on an active machine-learning method for adaptive questioning aimed at improving consumer decision-making processes, which relates to managing daily consumer interactions and preferences.",wos-machine learning,10,25,Active Machine Learning for Consideration Heuristics,2011
"Preference learning has been a topic of research in many fields, including operations research, marketing, machine learning, and behavioral economics. In this work, we strive to combine the ideas from these different fields into a single methodology to learn preferences and make decisions. We use robust and integer optimization in an adaptive and dynamic way to determine preferences from data that are consistent with human behavior. We use integer optimization to address human inconsistency, robust optimization and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to address loss aversion, and adaptive conjoint analysis and linear optimization to frame the questions to learn preferences. The paper makes the following methodological contributions: to the robust optimization literature by proposing a method to derive undertainty sets from adaptive questionnaires, to the marketing literature by using the analytic center of discrete sets (as opposed to polyhedra) to capture errors and inconsistencies, and to the risk modeling literature by using efficient methods from computer science for sampling to optimize CVaR.

"Probabilistic choice models that include choice-attributes are increasingly being utilized by decision makers, particularly in the business area. The output of these models are point estimates of the coefficients of the choice-attributes and rate of correct prediction. Accuracy measures of these point estimates are either based upon the asymptotic properties of the estimation procedures or are not provided. This paper indicates that bootstrap is a method by which the assumption of asymptotic properties can be empirically validated for a given model and can provide measures of accuracy on point estimates where currently no such measure exists. The empirical application of bootstrap to a real world data set indicates that decision makers will have considerably more information about their problem than is currently provided in the point estimates of the choice model.

"Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these forecasts to be realistic in terms of being able to replicate market shares at some prespecified or basecase scenario. Frequently, there is a discrepancy between the recovered and base- case market share. This paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating base- case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function. Because de. ning the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a variance as small as possible, but such that the market share constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies indicate that the method recovers base- case market shares without systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint experiment.","Gilbride, TJ; Lenk, PJ; Brazell, JD",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1080.0369,Bayesian decision theory; conjoint analysis; constrained optimization; cross-validation; hierarchical Bayes; loss function; market share prediction; penalized maximum likelihood; posterior risk,10.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to conjoint analysis, focusing on the recovery of base-case market shares and consumer preferences, which relates to managing day-to-day marketing research activities.",wos-prediction,10,20,Market Share Constraints and the Loss Function in Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis,2008

"Although the assumption of utility-maximizing consumers has been challenged for decades, empirical applications of alternative choice rules are still very new. We add to this growing body of literature by proposing a model based on the idea of a satisficing decision maker. In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them. The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial logit model.","Stüttgen, P; Boatwright, P; Monroe, RT",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1120.0732,noncompensatory choice; eye tracking; visual conjoint experiment,5.0,,65,5,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses a model for consumer decision-making that involves evaluating alternatives and making choices, which aligns with day-to-day consumer activities and preferences.

"The authors assumed that automatic preferences based on lowerorder affective processes have a greater impact on choice when people focus on their affective response to choice options (affective focus) than when they try to find reasons for their preferences (cognitive focus). They further supposed that the impact of the focus during decision making is less important when the cognitive resources of consumers are constrained. In an experiment, participants had to choose between two options while the cognitive or affective focus and processing resources were manipulated. Measures of automatic preferences correlated with choice under an affective, but not under a cognitive, focus. In contrast to expectations, this effect of focus was not moderated by the manipulation of processing resources. Interestingly, the automatic measures contributed to the prediction of choice under an affective focus independently and apart from self-report measures.

"To estimate customer demand, choice models rely both on what the individuals do and do not purchase. A customer may not purchase a product because it was not offered but also because it was not considered. To account for this behavior, existing literature has proposed the so-called consider-then-choose (CTC) models, which posit that customers sample a consideration set and then choose the most preferred product from the intersection of the offer set and the consideration set. CTC models have been studied quite extensively in the marketing literature. More recently, they have gained popularity within the operations management (OM) literature to make assortment and pricing decisions. Despite their richness, CTC models are difficult to estimate in practice because firms typically do not observe customers' consideration sets. Therefore, the common assumption in OM has been that customers consider everything on offer, so the consideration set is the same as the offer set. This raises the following question: When firms only collect transaction data, do CTC models provide any predictive advantage over classic choice models? More precisely, under what conditions do CTC models outperform (if ever) classic choice models in terms of prediction accuracy? In this work, we study a general class of CTC models. We propose techniques to estimate these models efficiently from sales transaction data. We then compare their performance against the classic approach. We find that CTC models outperform standard choice models when there is noise in the offer set information and the noise is asymmetric across the training and test offer sets but otherwise lead to no particular predictive advantage over the classic approach. We also demonstrate the benefits of using CTC models in real-world retail settings. In particular, we show that CTC models calibrated on retail transaction data are better at long-term and warehouse level sales forecasts. We also evaluate their performance in the context of an online platform setting: a peer-to-peer car sharing company. In this context, offer sets are even difficult to define. We observe a remarkable performance of CTC models over standard choice models therein.","Jagabathula, S; Mitrofanov, D; Vulcano, G",Operational,10.1287/opre.2022.0006,choice-based demand; consideration sets; consider-then-choose models; peer-to-peer platforms; retail operations; market analytics,10.0,,60,0,INFORMS,"The abstract primarily discusses the estimation and comparison of choice models, particularly in relation to customer demand and transaction data.

"In diverse social environments, recommendations from others have the power to change consumer behavior. In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from high-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing.","Guo, F; Zhang, XF; Ding, Y; Wang, XS",Operational,10.1037/npe0000051,recommendation; neural responses; event-related potentials; propensity; value measurement,15.0,,70,0,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"The study examines the cognitive processes related to consumer behavior and decision-making influenced by recommendations in online shopping, which are closely tied to day-to-day operational activities.",wos-recommendation,5,10,Recommendation Influence: Differential Neural Responses of Consumers During Shopping Online,2016
"We introduce a new recommendation technique based on fuzzy concepts such as the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation and the fuzzy market research system approach. The recommendation technique uses general consumer perception about product attributes of multiattributed products such as smartphones as input and gives consumers' sequential preference of the products as output. The recommendation technique explains the power of an attribute in predicting other attributes, especially in fuzzy and uncertain environments, through the conceptualisation of consumers' innate associations between the attributes. Our technique provides an understanding of consumer preference through the articulation of buyers' trade-offs amongst attributes of a product. (c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

"Software agents that provide consumers with personalized product recommendations based on individual-level feature-based preference models have been shown to facilitate better consumption choices while dramatically reducing the effort required to make these choices. This article examines why, despite their usefulness, such tools have not yet been widely adopted in the marketplace. We argue that the primary reason for this is that the usability of recommendation systems has been largely neglected - both in academic research and in practice - and we outline a roadmap for future research that might lead to recommendation agents that are more readily adopted by consumers.

"Firms increasingly seek to improve the online shopping experience by enabling customers to exchange product recommendations through social augmented reality (AR). We utilize socially situated cognition theory and conduct a series of five studies to explore how social AR supports shared decision making in recommender-decision maker dyads. We demonstrate that optimal configurations of social AR, that is, a static (vs. dynamic) point-of-view sharing format matched with an image-enhanced (vs. text-only) communicative act, increase recommenders' comfort with providing advice and decision makers' likelihood of using the advice in their choice. For both, these effects are due to a sense of social empowerment, which also stimulates recommenders' desire for a product and positive behavioral intentions. However, recommenders' communication motives impose boundary conditions. When recommenders have strong impression management concerns, this weakens the effect of social empowerment on recommendation comfort. Furthermore, the stronger a recommender's persuasion goal, the less likely the decision maker is to use the recommendation in their choice.","Hilken, T; Keeling, DI; de Ruyter, K; Mahr, D; Chylinski, M",Operational,10.1007/s11747-019-00688-0,Social augmented reality; Online shopping; Shared decision making; Customer-to-customer communication; Socially situated cognition,10.0,,65,0,SPRINGER,"The abstract discusses how social augmented reality (AR) enhances online shopping experiences through consumer recommendations, which falls under managing daily activities and consumer interactions.

"Recommendations often play a positive role in the decision process by reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options. However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive and more undesirable role from the perspectives of both the recommending agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a series of four studies, we explore consumer response when recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally contradicting them.","Fitzsimons, GJ; Lehmann, DR",Operational,10.1287/mksc.1030.0033,recommendations; intelligent agents; decision support systems; internet marketing,5.0,,60,5,INFORMS,"The abstract discusses consumer behavior and decision-making processes in response to recommendations from experts and intelligent agents, which aligns with managing day-to-day consumer interactions and preferences.",wos-recommendation,10,20,Reactance to recommendations: When unsolicited advice yields contrary responses,2004
"Based on cost-benefit theory and the value-percept diversity model, this study investigates the underlying mechanism that makes consumers feel satisfied with the use of interactive recommendation agents (IRAs). The format of IRAs was manipulated experimentally (attribute-based format/benefit-based format/no agent) and participants were classified as either expert or novice consumers. The dependent measures were the perceived costs and benefits of the information search process, the perceived costs and benefits of the decision-making process, and the degree of satisfaction with the outcome. The results explain the mechanisms underlying consumers' satisfaction when using an IRA. The findings also suggest the presence of an interaction between the expertise of consumers and the preferred type of IRA on various dependent variables.

"Commercial recommendation agents (RAs) represent an important type of the decision support systems (DSSs) that are widely used by online retailers and firms. To date, little is known about the factors that shape the user's decision making and reactance toward the recommendations of these agents. Building on theories from psychology and information systems domains, this research proposes that a user's self-construal and trust are two relevant factors that interact to shape the behavior toward the RA advice. Two studies, the first conducted using potential online customers and the second conducted at a behavioral laboratory, provided support to this proposition. The first study considered RA trust and showed that activating the interdependent self leads users with low (high) trust to exhibit high reactance behavior toward the RA advice. The second study variated trust using trust cues and corroborated the latter finding, while showing no important impact for the psychological reactance trait. As expected, in both studies the reactance behavior of independent users was not affected by trust. These results contribute by underscoring that social interdependence extends to RAs because the role of trust becomes salient when the interdependent self is activated for a user.","Aljukhadar, M; Trifts, V; Senecal, S",Operational,10.1002/mar.21017,decision making; DSS impact; reactance behavior; recommendation agents; self-construal; trust,10.0,,60,0,WILEY,"The abstract discusses factors influencing user behavior towards commercial recommendation agents, which are directly related to managing day-to-day activities in online retail settings, such as consumer decisions and recommendations online.",wos-recommendation,10,20,Consumer self-construal and trust as determinants of the reactance to a recommender advice,2017
"The present study examines the relationship between social influence and recommendation decisions among adolescents in the new media environment. Participants completed the App Recommendation Task a task that captures neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is significantly correlated with participants changing their recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects. Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the concept of being a successful idea salesperson, respectively. Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference shifts and consideration of the mental states of others in recommendation environments that include peer opinions.","Cascio, CN; O'Donnell, MB; Bayer, J; Tinney, FJ; Falk, EB",Operational,10.1509/jmr.13.0611,social influence; recommendations; word of mouth; mentalizing; valuation,5.0,,60,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"The study focuses on the decision-making processes involved in recommendation decisions among adolescents, specifically in the context of social influence and peer recommendations, which aligns well with managing day-to-day consumer decisions and recommendations online.",wos-recommendation,10,20,Neural Correlates of Susceptibility to Group Opinions in Online Word-of-Mouth Recommendations,2015
"Previous research has shown that people are influenced by others when making decisions. This work presents three studies examining herding in product choices on the Internet. The first two studies addressed how two cues frequently found on the Internet, that is, sales volume and customer reviews, influence consumer on-line product choices. The third study examined the relative effectiveness of two recommendation sources. The experimental results revealed that subjects used the choices and evaluations of others as cues for making their own choices. However, herding effects are offset significantly by negative comments from others. Additionally, the recommendations of other consumers influence the choices of subjects more effectively than recommendations from an expert. Finally, implications of this work are discussed.

"The work considers modification of the Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) to the so-called System 1 (S1) approach. S1 was described by D. Kahneman as a spontaneous and automatic reaction by an unconscious way in which human decision-makers choose among multiple alternatives. Application of S1 can be seen as a simplified BWS for data eliciting and express analysis of prioritization between many compared items. In S1, a respondent picks the items with which she feels “happy”, and those can be one, several, all, or none items in a task. Estimation of utilities is performed by multinomial-logit modeling with different optimization criteria which produce parameters of the models and choice probabilities of the items. Numerical examples by marketing research data are encouraging and demonstrating that spontaneous choice decisions can make S1 approach very fast, efficient, and convenient for express analysis of items prioritization, especially for big data. © 2019, © 2019 Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",Lipovetsky S.,Operational,10.1080/23270012.2019.1702112,BWS; choice probability; max diff; MNL utility; prioritization; System 1,10.0,,60,0,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,"The abstract discusses a method for quickly assessing consumer preferences through a modified Best-Worst Scaling approach, which aligns with operational tasks of determining consumer preferences and making decisions based on data.",scopus-big data,10,20,Express analysis for prioritization: Best–Worst Scaling alteration to System 1,2020
"In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers’ preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper’s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers. © 2016 INFORMS.",Lu S.; Xiao L.; Ding M.,Operational,10.1287/mksc.2016.0984,Collaborative filtering; Retailing; Video analysis,10.0,,60,0,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,"The abstract describes a system that automates garment recommendations based on real-time shopper behavior and preferences, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities in retail settings.",scopus-computer vision,10,20,A video-based automated recommender (VAR) system for garments,2016
"Modeling the decision-making process of online consumers in a proper way can provide strategic suggestions on operation management and service marketing for electronic commerce firms. In recent years, many researches have tried to model the consumers’ decision-making process from different perspectives, like considering consumers' behavior patterns, integrating consumption theories, and utilizing different methods or tools. Most of these researches build models based on the Expected Utility Theory which depends on the ""Rational People"" hypothesis. However, online consumers often make some ""bounded rational"" or ""irrational"" decisions in an electronic commerce environment, due to peers’ influence. Therefore, Prospect Theory, which is dependent on the ""Irrational People"" hypothesis, is selected as the theoretical basis in this paper. We replace the traditional expected utility function with Prospect Theory’s value function to build a reasonable behavioral decision-making model. Moreover, an improvement in value function is acquired by the introduction of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. We provide our approach in detail as follows. First, we construct the behavioral decision-making model based on Prospect Theory. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to express fuzzy decision-making information, which brings about improved value function, improved weight function as well as improved prospect function. We also build a more appropriate behavioral decision-making model. Therefore, we have determined the basic form of the model. Secondly, the whole service process of B2C electronic commerce is divided into six sub-processes by using service blueprinting. Based on these six sub-processes, the multiple attribute decision-making problem is defined through the determination of the multiple attribute structure and the set of alternatives which includes three dominant B2C platforms in China, e.g. Jingdong (jd.com), Yihaodian (yhd.com) and Dangdang (dangdang.com). Hence, the behavioral decision-making model of online consumers based on Prospect Theory has been determined. Thirdly, the behavioral model of decision-making is quantified by means of text mining of the collected eWOMs (Electronic Word-of-Mouth). The details of the process are showed as follows. First, we construct a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for eWOMs, which classifies eWOMs into different service sub-processes. Then the eWOMs in different sub-processes are clustered by the use of Weka, which is a data mining kit. Based on the clustering results, we can define 13 evaluating indicators and their corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the eWOMs into intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers, which determine the parameters of our model according to the results of sentiment analysis. Therefore, the model is quantified. Finally, we take Jingdong, Yihaodian and Dangdang as examples to test the behavioral model of decision-making. Furthermore, the reliability of this behavioral decision-making model is identified by comparison with the model based on the Expected Utility Theory. The results show that: (1) Compared with the models which are based on Expected Utility Theory, the behavioral decision model proposed in this paper performs better to reveal the practical situation. (2) Results of the calculated examples show that Jingdong scores the highest prospect values, followed by Yihaodian and Dangdang. Clustering of eWOMs results in 13 indicators. Jingdong scores the highest prospect values in seven indicators, while Yihaodian scores the highest ones in four indicators. Though Jingdong takes the highest overall score, its score is the lowest one in after-sales stage, giving rise to a narrowed gap in total score. While Yihaodian’s excellent service recovery help itself to rank second.

"With the advent of users’ perspective to store personal information digitized, measures to protect their private information has necessitated. Organizations also publish anonymous data to facilitate research in social science, healthcare, identification of fraudulent users, and trend analysis to foster sales and marketing techniques. Privacy Preserving Data Mining [PPDM] protects the disclosure of sensitive information present in the published datasets. Most of the existing pool of algorithms perturb the attributes forbidding verification of original data at receivers’ end. This paper introduces a Reversible Data Perturbation iHiMod-Perturb approach efficient in privacy preservation and enabling recovery of original data, if needed, at the receiver end. Unlike traditional methods that adds/multiply noise or randomly project data, our method uses differences of adjoining values as basis for modification to perturb sensitive attributes. Selection of privacy factor and embedding of digital watermark ensures data integrity along with perturbation. The privacy factor enables user specific adaptable privacy preservation model in contrast to one-level model. Experiments are performed on five datasets from UCI Repository and confirms that the Classification Accuracy of the perturbed dataset is preserved well.

By using the developed formal model and the performed critical analysis of methods and technologies for predicting the exchange rate of cryptocurrency, we have built a general architecture of the content processing system that acquires data from different cryptocurrency Internet stock exchanges. General functional requirements to the intelligent cryptocurrency system that target the Internet users have been stated. We have investigated methods, models, and tools to improve the effective support for developing structural elements in the model of a decision support system that manages content according to the user's needs. general architectures of the backend and frontend parts of an intelligent cryptocurrency system have been devised. We also developed software for the system of integration and generation of content considering the cryptocurrency needs of users. An analysis of results of experimental verification of the proposed method for content integration and generation taking into consideration the cryptocurrency needs of users has been performed. A special feature of the system is that it analyzes information from social media and builds a forecast of currency rates based on the acquired information. A given system makes it possible to guess the trend in an exchange rate fluctuation. Conferences of a particular cryptocurrency, new implementations, government decrees from different countries, affect a trend as well, so it too must be taken into consideration. In order to account for most cases, it is necessary to constantly accumulate information on the subject and to assign it to Tables in a database. A given process takes place using a specialized software bot that collects and indexes information. The system is characterized by the following features that favorably distinguish it from analogs: the speed of page generation; the presence of SSL certificate and TLS encryption; content of better quality as it is updated every minute; there are no inactive sections of the service; the mobile web-site layout does not copy content at subdomain; automated checks against e-mail spam messages on the exchange rate.

"Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers 'preference indicator. © 2023 All rights reserved",Filipas A.M.; Vretenar N.; Prudky I.,Operational,10.18045/zbefri.2023.1.157,Consumers'preferences; Data mining; Decision trees; Decision-making; Shopping behaviour indicators,10.0,,60,0,University of Rijeka,"The research focuses on understanding consumer preferences in online shopping, which involves determining influences on consumer behavior and constructing preference indicators.

In so doing, we discuss examples, data sources, methodological challenges, anticipated benefits, and research pathways to fully interweave network and choice models. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Feinberg F.; Bruch E.; Braun M.; Falk B.H.; Fefferman N.; Feit E.M.D.; Helveston J.; Larremore D.; McShane B.B.; Patania A.; Small M.L.,Operational,10.1007/s11002-020-09541-9,Choice models; Computational social science; Data science; Decision theory; Marketing; Networks,10.0,,60,0,Springer,"The abstract discusses the integration of network science and choice theory, focusing on models that help understand consumer preferences and decision-making processes, which aligns closely with operational tasks such as choice modeling and determining consumer preferences.",scopus-data science,10,20,Choices in networks: a research framework,2020
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure student’s preferences regarding various attributes that affect their decision process while choosing a higher education area of study. Design/methodology/approach: The paper exhibits two different models which shed light on the perceived value of each examined area of study: conjoint analysis and clustering k-means algorithm. Findings: The findings of the used methods exhibit not only which of the attributes have the greatest influence on students’ decision-making process, but also shed light on which types of study areas are most preferred by respondents. Originality/value: The paper addresses a new view on students’ definition of higher education when adding the choice of selecting the “proper” area of study to one’s profile. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Shtudiner Z.; Zwilling M.; Kantor J.,Operational,10.1108/IJEM-02-2016-0031,Area of study; Conjoint analysis; Decision support systems and marketing; Higher education and preferences,5.0,,60,5,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,"The abstract discusses methods like conjoint analysis and clustering to understand student preferences regarding higher education areas of study, which involve decision-making at a more precise, day-to-day activity level.",scopus-k-means,10,20,Field of study choice: using conjoint analysis and clustering,2017
"With the recent development of web 2.0, there has been a lot of increase in social networking and online marketing sites. The data obtained from these sites are analysed for better human decision making. Sentiment analysis involves extraction of sentiments from reviews. Sentiments can be positive, negative or neutral. Most of the content on the internet is in the English language, but with the improved awareness of people, data in other languages is increasing gradually. Not much work has been done in Indian languages. Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English, is an informal language which is exceptionally famous in India as individuals feel greater talking in their language. In this paper, we present a dictionary-based approach for Hinglish text classification. We also implemented traditional machine learning classification algorithms such as SVM, NB and ME for comparison. It is found that for Hinglish text, dictionary-based classification gives best accuracy results.

"Brand choice models, used for describing the process of choosing mutually exclusive alternatives, attracted a large amount of attention from researchers in the early of the recent decade. These models can be used as a market response simulator for simulating marketing strategies and assessing how changes in marketing variables such as pricing and promotions will influence consumer behavior and thus perform 'what-if' simulations. So a reliable and relevant brand choice model can be very useful and effective, which, in fact, represents a worthwhile opportunity to improve the efficiency of the marketing decisions. In this paper we offer a new approach by integrating of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Data preprocessing for brand choice modeling and constructing a market response simulator. This approach, called Preprocessed-Probabilistic Neural Network (PPNN), consists of two main stages. First, a robust Genetic Based Instance Selection Model (GBIS) employed to look for a representative data subset of instances in training data set. The second stage ends up with a relevant brand choice model, using a probabilistic neural network trained by Dynamic Decay Adjustment Algorithm (DDA). The evaluation process is carried out using the same data set been used in literature for modeling individual consumer choices in a retail coffee market. The evaluation results show that the offered approach outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as an effective tool for consumer behavior modeling and simulation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Over time, research on order effects during information searching and choice tasks has received thorough attention in marketing, psychology, and economics. When early information search influences choice in favor of that information, it is called primacy; the equivalent for later information search is called recency. However, research that disentangles primacy and recency effects during multi-attribute product choice, as well as studies on the cognitive processes underlying primacy and recency effects are lacking. I address this gap with two choice-based conjoint experiments combined with eye tracking and by means of multilevel mediation analysis. Consistent with my prediction that to counterbalance the impact of decision irrelevant information on choice through early information search by later information search is mentally too costly, I find that “spatial position” biases choice due to primacy rather than recency. This bias, however, is small. This suggests that for decision irrelevant information, the causal influence of attention on choice generalizes to more complex decisions, though with little impact. Consistent with my prediction that the level of information elaboration moderates the mediation process, increasing task motivation decreases the dominance of primacy. © 2023 The Author.

"With the popularity of social media, extracting consumer preferences from online consumer-generated content is of vital importance for product/service providers to develop tailored marketing strategies. However, existing approaches face difficulties analyzing consumer preferences over different attributes of alternatives (restaurants, hotels, etc.), which hinders product/service providers from comprehensively understanding consumer choice decisions. To address this issue, we solve for the consumer preferences over the attributes represented by attribute weights based on consumers’ historical data, including text comments and overall ratings. Specifically, for each comment and a corresponding rating, we first employ sentiment analysis to calculate values of the attributes, and then develop a quadratic programming model to solve for the weights. Based on a stream of a consumer's text comments and overall ratings, we can correspondingly obtain a stream of weights indexed by the comment time. We then model this stream of weights as hesitant judgments and employ a hesitant multiplicative programming method to solve for the final weights that fit the consumer's preferences over attributes at the highest satisficing level. In the application of recommendation, our approach not only provides insights into the consumer's preferences but also has higher prediction power compared with some state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Zhu B.; Guo D.; Ren L.,Operational,10.1016/j.im.2022.103626,Consumer preference; Decision analysis; Hesitant judgment; Pairwise comparisons; Recommendation; Sentiment analysis,10.0,,60,0,Elsevier B.V.,"The abstract focuses on the management of consumer preferences using historical data and sentiment analysis, which aligns with managing day-to-day activities related to consumer decisions and recommendations.",scopus-prediction,10,20,Consumer preference analysis based on text comments and ratings: A multi-attribute decision-making perspective,2022
"Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the ""right"" model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a ""generic"" model of consumer choice (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step toward ""automating"" the crucial task of choice model selection. © 2013 INFORMS.",Farias V.F.; Jagabathula S.; Shah D.,Operational,10.1287/mnsc.1120.1610,Choice models; Marketing mix; Nonparametric choice; Preference list; Revenue prediction; Utility preference,10.0,,60,0,,"The abstract discusses a nonparametric approach to choice modeling and revenue predictions, which is closely related to managing day-to-day decisions in marketing operations, such as consumer preferences and choice modeling.",scopus-prediction,10,20,A nonparametric approach to modeling choice with limited data,2013
"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a contextfree partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",Rooderkerk R.P.; Van Heerde H.J.; Bijmolt T.H.A.,Operational,10.1509/jmkr.48.4.767,Behavioral decision making; Choice models; Context effects; Hierarchical bayes; Product line design,10.0,,60,0,American Marketing Association,"The abstract discusses a discrete-choice model that decomposes product utility into context-free and context-dependent components, which is directly related to managing consumer preferences and choice modeling.
